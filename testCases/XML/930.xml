		  After a century of public library service and progress, public
		libraries attract less than a third, perhaps only a quarter of the adult
		population, either to read and borrow books, or to look up information.  
		But nearly 60 per cent of the population is over 21. Currently a few large city
		libraries show slight decreases in  annual circulation, the major measure
		of their usefulness.  Yet, nationally, circulation and the informational use 
		of public libraries have in general steadily increased, especially in the last 
		decade.  Possibly  because the number of public, college, university, and 
		special libraries doubled, from 13,676 reported in 1960, to 27,746 in 1968 
		(Publishers' Weekly, January 20, 1969).  And there are more than that many 
		school libraries.
