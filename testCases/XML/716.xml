		  Most discussions about the future design of chemical information systems
		emphasize the effects of computer speed on composition, storage, searching,
		and retrieval.  Little attention has been paid to the behavior of the
		scientist (chemist) toward the learning process and the role of the literature
		in that learning process.  The ACS has gained some insight into this behavior
		and thus urges caution before one leaps to the uncritical conclusion that
		the literature as now constituted is dead but has not yet fallen over.  What
		seems more likely, when human behavior patterns are considered, is that the
		new and the old will co-exist side by side for several generations, and that
		the system's current emphasis on completeness will be replaced with selective
		compression.
