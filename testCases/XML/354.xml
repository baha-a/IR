		  The schedules of Edition 18, like those of 17, are based on the
		principle of subject integrity.  Both the subject matter and the notation are
		hierarchical, so that what is true of a given whole is true of all its parts.
		The schedules are developed according to logical principles, so that the
		classifier is guided to make correct decisions.  The terminology of the
		classification scheme reflects the terminology used by the literature
		being classified.
		  For ease of use, this edition includes many more example notes, more detailed
		and precise instructions, and freer use of layman's terminology than did its
		immediate predecessor.
		  Since this edition is intended for use as a shelf-arrangement system for
		general libraries of all sizes, its fulness is based upon the number of titles
		that large libraries may be expected to acquire in various fields.  Since
		it is also intended for use in classified catalogs and bibliographies (for
		which the Dewey Decimal Classification is increasingly in demand in many
		countries), it contains an increased number of provisions for number building.
