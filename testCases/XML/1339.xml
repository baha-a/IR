	<title>The Social System of Science	</title>

		        This book, is an exercise in sociological theory-
		building.  It attempts to develop a theory of the social organization
		of science.  I have tried to indicate its possible broader relevance
		by pointing out certain basic parallels between the "social system"
		of science and other social systems within society.  I hope, further,
		that the approach used - even if not the specific conclusions I
		have drawn from it - may be useful in bridging the gap that seems
		now to exist between those sociologists who are concerned with
		society as an entity and who analyze social behavior in terms of
		its consequences for society as a whole and those sociologists who
		are concerned first of all with the motives, attitudes, and goals
		of the individual participants in these patterns of social behavior.
		My approach hopes to answer the question of why it is that most
		individuals, most of the time, come to "want" to do what it is
		that society "needs" them to do.  Only when we can answer this
		question satisfactorily, can we develop a sociology capable of 
		providing both prediction and meaning.
