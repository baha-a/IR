		   Technical communication patterns in two research and development laboratories
		were examined using modified sociometric techniques.. The structure of 
		technical communication networks in the two laboratories results from the 
		interaction of both social relations and work structure.. The sociometric 
		"stars" in the technical communication network who provide other members of the
		organization with information either make greater use of individuals outside
		the organization or read the literature more than other members of the 
		laboratory..
