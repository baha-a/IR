		        The two studies presented here represent efforts
		to measure the performance of library staffs in an unobstrusive
		fashion:  that is, to apply certain tests generally
		similar to portions of the normal workload without drawing
		attention to the fact that a test is being carried out.  The
		two projects were rather different as to purpose, method,
		and reliability of result (that is, statistical significance).
		Dr. Crowley's investigation, the first in point of time,
		arose partly from his experience in a county library.  His
		curiousity about the real result of the reference activities
		(as different from merely counting the questions answered)
		led him to ask, "Is there substantial difference between the
		claims made by librarians for reference work and the actual
		result as observed in a number of different situations by
		individuals posing as clients?"  The study which followed
		from this question was, then, exploratory and necessarily
		less rigidly controlled than was the second study of this
		pair.
