		  Developing from the definitions of the concept language a terminological
		represented model of the communication process can be deduced that shows
		the transfer of meaning between communicator and recipient through
		communication channels and mediators.  The distinguished communication
		structures are communication sequences, chains, nets and systems.  With an
		universal definition of data as fixed representations of facts by means of
		signs the various meanings of the term "information" are terminological to
		differentiate as "information," "information process" and "informations."
		The theory of signs makes the differentiation of syntactical, semantical,
		sigmatical and pragmatical information possible.  Adequate to communication
		process and system we can determine informing process and information system.
