	<title>Progress in Documentation:The Development of Precis:  A Theoretical and Technical History	</title>

		  Before starting to trace the development of PRECIS to its
		theoretical beginnings I shall describe the system briefly in its present
		form.  This will serve not only as an introduction for those who are not
		familiar with the system, but will also help to explain the relevance of
		some of the historical sections which follow, in which we shall see how a
		machine-produced alphabetical indexing system, based on a syntax derived
		from a study of natural language, developed out of research into 
		principles for a new general classification.
		  PRECIS, or the PREserved Context Indexing System, differs in some
		respects from traditional alphabetical indexes and lists of subject headings.
		Like the system developed by Coates for the British Technology Index,
		PRECIS consists essentially of a set of working procedures, not a prescribed
		list of terms or phrases.  The system is firmly based upon the concept of an
		open-ended vocabulary, which means that terms can be admitted into the
		index at any time, as soon as they have been encountered in literature.
		Once a term has been admitted, its relationships with other terms are
		handled in two different ways, distinguished as the syntactical and the
		semantic sides of the system.
