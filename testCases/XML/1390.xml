		  The investigation of interlibrary loans among academic libraries was
		initiated by the Interlibrary Loan Study Committee of the Association of
		Research Libraries.  It was seen as a fundamental first step toward the
		solution of current problems and the exploration of the means to improve
		interlibrary loan services nationally.  This report provides solid
		information that is basic to any future planning at the national level.
