		  Since 1958 the Chemical Abstracts Service has been
		working toward establishing a computer-based system for
		handling chemical information.  Briefly, the concept of
		the CAS system consists of sets of special subject files
		in the following categories: (1) physical properties, (2)
		chemical reactivities, (3) biochemical activities, and (4)
		applications.  With the importance of compounds in
		correlation studies, and the need to interrelate compounds
		and the huge collections of chemical and other data, a
		highly developed subsystem, called the Registry System,
		for handling compounds must be the first step in the
		actual operation of an over-all computer-based service.
		The Registry System will include files of compounds 
		interconnected with files of associated data that permit
		identifying the compounds and retrieving them from the
		files.
