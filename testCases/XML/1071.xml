		   This Core Medical Library has been revised, updated and expanded in the hope 
		of providing a single library facility for the entire health-care team.. Items
		were included in the list on the basis of recommendations submitted by 
		specialists in the pertinent fields.. The expanded core collection costs about
		4,000.. Space requirements are about 40 linear feet for books, 90 feet for 
		journals and 15 feet for reference tools..
