		    The motivation for this investigation derived from a
		series of visits to institutions which were deeply committed
		to the design, development, and operation of non-traditional
		automated information systems.  At the time of the visits,
		the systems seemed to be working technically but, paradoxically,
		they did not appear to have made a significant impact on the
		respective user communities.  Although few people associated
		with the systems openly expressed concern, there were non-verbal
		indicators which suggested that some people were becoming nervous.
		Since all of the systems represented high expenditures of time
		and money, a feeling of uneasiness seemed quite appropriate.
