		   An evaluation of the Chemical Society's Chemical Titles information
		retrieval service compared with a parallel manual search of the literature
		has shown that, at least in certain disciplines, more than 90 per cent of the
		desired information can be obtained..  This is quite adequate for most
		commercial and scientific purposes..
