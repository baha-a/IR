	<title>Scientific Communication:Its Role in the Conduct of Research and Creation of Knowledge	</title>
	<author>Garvey, W.DGriffith, B.C.	</author>
	<text>
		  There is considerable apprehension today
		within the scientific community over the
		communication crisis in science.  The present
		article, which attempts to clarify certain aspects
		of the problem, overviews the data collected by the
		APA Project on Scientific Information Exchange in
		Psychology, together with data which we have
		more recently obtained relative to other disciplines.
		Such a reexamination of the data should help to
		clarify APA's relationship to the many information
		media involved in the communication process
		which begins with research and ends with the
		incorporation of research findings into psychological
		knowledge.
