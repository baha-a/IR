	<text>
		  The goal of this book, Library Automation: Experience, Methodology,
		and Technology of the Library as an Information System, is to
		provide a perspective of the library functions that have been or
		might be mechanized or automated, an outline of the methodology
		of the systems approach, an overview of the technology available to
		the library, and a projection of the prospects for library automation.
		  There is a concern in every library for the proper handling and
		control of a veritable flood of material and for the prompt and
		convenient fulfillment of service demands.  That concern is matched by
		excitement about the possibilities for effective use of the computers
		and communications network in many library functions.  Knowledge,
		the library's stock-in-trade, is being generated at an unprecedented
		rate and sought after with unprecedented intensity.  Technology, the
		driving force behind the library's problems and one hope for future
		solution, is being advanced to unprecedented levels.
