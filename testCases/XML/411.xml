		  Two methods were used:  (1) A thorough search of professional
		literature, principally since 1965, with exceptions in
		cases where no later information was available, and (2) direct
		communication with associations through a questionnaire and
		consultation of supplementary material provided by the associations.
		The final result of the authors' search was a total of 319
		library associations, 33 international in scope and 286 national
		(see Statistical Data).
