		  The program which I will discuss has the primary objective of making new 
		technology and research information, generated in federally-supported research 
		programs, available for use by industry and government for both private and 
		public benefits.  Our group had no part in creating the information resources 
		which we use, except for the design of the computer retrieval system.  Although
		we work with and depend on conventional libraries and librarians, we have no
		professional librarians on our staff.
