		   On-line interactive searching of several information bases through several
		service operators was introduced in an industrial research environment.. 
		Thorough knowledge of the information base and its structure in the search
		system is a major factor of successful searching, and differences among search
		systems do not present serious barriers.. This new technique was most 
		effectively used when the information specialist and the scientist searched as
		a team.. On-line searching is now an established search tool at Exxon Research
		and Engineering Company..
