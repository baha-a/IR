		   The indexing of a document is among the most crucial steps in preparing that 
		document for retrieval.. The adequacy of the indexing determines the ability of 
		the system to respond to patron requests.. This paper discusses this process,
		and document retrieval in general, on the basis of formal decision theory.. The
		basic theoretical approach taken is illustrated by means of a model of word 
		occurrences in documents in the context of a model information system; both 
		models are fully defined in this paper.. Though the main purpose of this paper
		is to provide insights into a very complex process, formulae are developed that 
		may prove to be of value for an automated operating system..The paper concludes
		with an interpretation of recall and precision curves as seen from the point of 
		view of decision theory..
