		   The Price Gilbert Memorial Library of the Georgia Institute of Technology has 
		reproduced its entire card catalog on microfiche, and is updating this basic 
		file with a bimonthly cumulated supplement produced by the Computer Output
		Microfiche (COM) process.. The total catalog has been placed, with in 
		appropriate microfiche reader, in every academic and research department on
		campus - thereby taking the chief bibliographic record of the library to the 
		faculty user.. Remote bibliographic access is complemented by a telephone 
		request and delivery service which provides delivery of requested books or
		photocopies from the library to the faculty member..
