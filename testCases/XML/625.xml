	<title>On Selecting a Measure of Retrieval Effectiveness	</title>

		   It is argued that a user's subjective evaluation of the personal
		utility of a retrieval system's output to him, if it could be properly
		quantified, would be a near-ideal measure of retrieval effectiveness..
		A hypothetical methodology is presented for measuring this utility by
		means of an elicitation procedure.. Because the hypothetical methodology
		is impractical, compromise methods are outlined and their underlying
		simplifying assumptions are discussed.. The more plausible the simplifying
		assumptions on which a performance measure is based, the better the measure..
		This, along with evidence gleaned from 'validation experiments' of a certain
		kind, is suggested as a criterion for selecting or deriving the best measure
		of effectiveness to use under given test conditions..
