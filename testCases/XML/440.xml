		   This article is the last in series which describes a set of studies which
		were conducted over a 4,5-year period (1966-1971).. The series of articles 
		sought to describe a comprehensive picture of the dissemination and assimilation
		of scientific information as it flows through various informal and formal media,
		from the time a scientist initiates his work until it is published.. The 
		present article examines the continuity of scientific work and information 
		exchange by "productive scientists" two years after the publication of their 
		articles in 1968/1969.. The results indicate that about half of the authors had
		changed to a subject-matter area which differed from that of their earlier
		articles, however, such shifts did not decrease authors' productivity nor 
		greatly increase their information needs..
