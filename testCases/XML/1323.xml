		   The present collection of articles discusses three basic problems:  the
		typological classification of information retrieval languages, the formal 
		method of lexical semantic research, and textual semantics. Problems 
		connected with lexical word meaning, the building up of semantic fields using 
		computers, and automatic indexing are considered.
