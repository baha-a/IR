	<author>Salton, G.Yang, C. S.	</author>
	<text>
		   The existing practice in automatic indexing is reviewed, and it is shown
		 that the standard theories for the specification of term values (or weights)
		are not adequate.. New techniques are introduced for the assignment of weights
		to index terms, based on the characteristics of individual document 
		collections.. The effectiveness of some of the proposed methods is evaluated..
