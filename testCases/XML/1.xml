		   The present study is a history of the DEWEY Decimal
		Classification.  The first edition of the DDC was published
		in 1876, the eighteenth edition in 1971, and future editions
		will continue to appear as needed.  In spite of the DDC's
		long and healthy life, however, its full story has never
		been told.  There have been biographies of Dewey
		that briefly describe his system, but this is the first
		attempt to provide a detailed history of the work that
		more than any other has spurred the growth of
		librarianship in this country and abroad.
