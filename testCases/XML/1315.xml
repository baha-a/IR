		  This work is concerned with the influence of scientific colleagues on the
		conduct of one another's research.  With few exceptions, the discussion is
		limited to basic research in experimental sciences with well-established
		theories.  In this type of research, the scientific community is relatively
		autonomous, and the group of colleagues is the most important source of
		social influence on research.  Colleagues influence decisions to select
		problems and techniques, to publish results, and to accept theories.
