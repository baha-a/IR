		   A statistical description based on a mail survey of personnel in 2,099
		health sciences libraries located outside of the hospital setting is reported..
		Respondents to the survey were divided into three groups: professionals (those
		possessing a graduate library degree); nonprofessionals (those not possessing
		graduate library degree); and chief librarians (those responsible for a
		library's operations).. Survey items dealt with education, sex, age, salary,
		job mobility and preference for continuing education programs..
		   Some 60 percent of the respondents were professionals; 40 percent were
		nonprofessionals.. Seven hundred and twenty-eight chief librarians were 
		identified in the population: 57 percent were professional librarians while
		the remainder were without a graduate library degree.. Approximately 1/5
		of all survey respondents were men.. The age distribution for the work force
		tended to be bimodal, reflecting the career patterns of women and the later
		entry of men into librarianship.. The annual salary for male professionals was
		calculated at $12,732; for female professionals at $10,044; for male
		nonprofessionals at $7,878; and for female nonprofessionals at $6,313.. Male
		professionals were found to have the highest rates of job and geographic
		mobility.. Conversely, female nonprofessionals were lowest in mobility.. In
		expressing a preference for continuing education programs in library science,
		professionals tended to request courses dealing with the organization of
		libraries, health sciences institutions and their relationships, while 
		nonprofessionals inclined towards courses in technical processing..
