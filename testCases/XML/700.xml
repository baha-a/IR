		  A major problem in the design of screening systems for substructure searches
		of chemical structure files is the development of a methodology for selection of
		an optimal set of structural characteristics to act as screens.  The set chosen
		for a particular application will depend on the characteristics of the
		collection, as well as on its size and growth rate.  A strategy which takes
		account of the disparate frequencies of the various species of fragments
		in a data-base by use of differential, and, in part, hierarchical levels of
		description is detailed.  The distributions of a variety of structural
		characteristics, including bond-centered, atom-centered, and ring fragments
		in a 30,000-compound sample of the Chemical Abstracts Service Registry System
		are summarized.  Implementation of the approach, using primarily bond-centered
		fragments, by means of simple and highly efficient computer programs, is
		detailed.
