	<title>The Planning of Academic and Research Library Buildings	</title>
	<author>Metcalf, K.D.	</author>
	<text>
		  This volume deals with the planning of academic
		and research library buildings.  Library buildings
		house library collections of various kinds, chiefly
		books and other printed matter; seating accommodations
		and other facilities for library users; quarters for
		the library staff that acquires, catalogues, and serves
		the collections; and, in addition, architectural or
		what is preferably known as non-assignable space.
		(If there if space left over after caring for the
		above needs, it is sometimes assigned for other
		purposes.)
