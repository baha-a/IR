		  In this study, five major criteria (realism, flexibility, capability, case
		of use, and cost) for evaluating the suitability of management science models
		for R and D project selection are established, through personal interviews with
		RandD administrators and management scientists.  A suitability rating system,
		based on these criteria, is used by the author to rate twenty-six management
		science models for their suitability of use in RandD project selection decision
		making.  Profitability index and scoring types of models were found to have
		generally higher ease of use and lower cost performances than the other types.
		The linear and nonlinear models had generally higher flexibility, while the
		linear, nonlinear and zero-one models had generally higher realism than the
		other model types.
