	<title>The Social Psychology of Organizations	</title>

		  In our attempts to extend the description and explanation of
		organizational processes we have shifted from an earlier emphasis on
		traditional concepts of individual psychology and interpersonal
		relations to system constructs.  The interdependent behavior of many
		people in their supportive and complementary actions takes on a form
		or structure which needs to be conceptualized at a more appropriate
		collective level.  Classical organization theory we found unsatisfactory
		because of its implicit assumptions about the closed character of social
		structures.  The development of open-system theory, on the other hand,
		furnished a much more dynamic and adequate framework.  Hence, our
		effort, in the pages that follow, is directed at the utilization of
		an open-system point of view for the study of large-scale organizations.
