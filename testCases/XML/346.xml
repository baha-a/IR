		  Information, whose handling is the topic of this book, is
		generated by change, and whatever is our unit of change is our unit of
		information.  In a situation in which only three possible moves can
		be made, only three fundamental units of information can be found,
		no matter how complex a structure we may build upon them.  Our
		topic is therefore a special sort of change, the change brought about
		in acquiring or keeping or transmitting elements of knowledge.
