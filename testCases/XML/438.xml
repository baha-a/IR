		  This book summarizes the results of three years of research at the
		Center for Educational Policy Research.  The eight coauthors were all
		Research Associates at the Center, and our work there was a collaborative
		effort.  We plagiarized both ideas and data from one another.  Most of
		us also spent a good deal of time criticizing one another's work.  While
		each of us took primary responsibility for certain lines of inquiry, and
		this responsibility is recorded in appropriate footnotes, we see our
		research as an integrated effort which should bear all our names.
