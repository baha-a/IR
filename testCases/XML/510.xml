		   By the means of the flexible machine search system three experiments have 
		been made in order to test the retrieval efficiency of searching free text and 
		keywords.. Base upon the relevance judgements of the users, the results 
		indicate that titles and abstracts are good index material which can be used 
		for machine searching without human indexing in the three fields studies..
