	<title>Feasibility Study of a Scheme for Reconciling Thesauri Covering a Common Subject	</title>

		   The feasibility is examined of devising a scheme for operating a joint 
		keyword system in a given subject area using several independently compiled 
		thesauri.. It is suggested that if the individual keywords of each 
		participating thesaurus represent indentifiable concepts, and these concepts are
		given unique code numbers, then the code numbers enable the keywords of any
		participating thesaurus to be converted into the appropriate keywords of any
		other participant.. Incompatibilities between keywords systems arise from 
		differences in the selection and form of keywords.. Eleven types of 
		incompatibility are identified and a method of reconciliation is proposed for 
		each.. The types of incompatibility that can arise in a single language include 
		those that arise between one language and another, so that a multilingual joint 
		system presents no additional problems..
