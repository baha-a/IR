		  Simultaneously with its development of a computer-based Chemical Compound
		Registry System, Chemical Abstracts Service is devising procedures for 
		automatically converting systematic names of organic compounds into atom-
		bound connection tables which can be manipulated by computer.  A study of
		systematic Chemical Abstracts (CA) index names has resulted in a dictionary
		of word roots used in the names and in step-by-step procedures for converting 
		names to connection tables.  Statistical studies of nomenclature in CA indexes
		show that these procedures are applicable not only to current nomenclature,
		but also generally to names in past indexes.  Procedures have been written
		which are applicable to the majority of names of carbon compounds, and the
		preparation of computer programs is now under way.
