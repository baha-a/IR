		   A method of developing computer catalogs is proposed which does not require
		unit card conversion but rather the accumulation of data from operating 
		programs..  It is proposed that the bibliographic and finding functions of the
		catalog be separated, with the latter being the first automated.. Such 
		automation is seen as being advantageous on a cost basis..
