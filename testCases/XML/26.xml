		This article discusses the possibility of exploiting the
		statistics of word co-occurrence in text for purposes of
		document retrieval. Co-occurrence is defined and related
		to the mental processes of authors and readers; several
		means of quantitative measurement of word co-occurrence
		are then scrutinized.  It is shown that the most
		strongly co-occurring word pairs, which are therefore
		"associated" in a statistical sense, can be represented
		in the form of an "association map."  The last half of the
		article presents two modes of use of association maps
		in literature searching.
