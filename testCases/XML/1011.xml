		                Unmistakable signs are pointing the way toward
		the creation sometime soon of a national information network
		in the United States.  The concept of a national network implies
		the interconnection of existing information systems and libraries
		through communications.  Certainly one of the great strengths of this
		nation is the great array of intellectual, scholarly, and research
		resources to be found in its libraries and information centers.  
		Without integration and close cooperation, however, these resources
		will remain a series of separate, insulated institutions.  But if
		maximum communication can be established among them, this array can
		be converted into a national resource of immense value to citizens
		throughout the country.
