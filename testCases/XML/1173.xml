	<author>Kazachkov, L. S.Khursin, L. A.	</author>
	<text>
		   The paper treats the probability distribution in information flow systems, 
		and presents the analysis of a statistical distribution model called the 
		"hyperbolic ladder" and of the consequences following from this model which 
		were revealed in linguistics (Zipf), theory of scientific information 
		(Bradford), and in science of science (Lotka), etc.. The identity of the
		mathematical essence of various distributions, investigated by many authors on
		their own objects of study, is shown..
		   The link is considered between the basic probability distribution and some
		problems studied in the modern mathematical theory of information.. Examples 
		are presented of the use of distribution regularities in various systems
		analysis..
