		  This book is intended both as a textbook for library school students
		and a handbook for practicing librarians.  It will acquaint the former
		with the basic tools of the management analyst and will aid the latter
		in improving their present systems.  The major analysis techniques are
		described in step-by-step detail, with a wealth of illustrations and
		library examples.
