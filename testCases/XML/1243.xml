	<title>Rare Book Librarianship	</title>

		  Although there is an extensive and enjoyable literature on the subject
		of rare books, most of it is concerned with bibliography or book
		collecting, and relatively little on the librarianship of rare books
		is available.  This book is an attempt to consider some of the problems
		of custodianship and exploitation of special collections in libraries;
		problems sufficiently different, I believe, to make the concept of rare
		book librarianship a valid one.  It is based distantly upon lecture notes
		for a course on this subject which was offered to postgraduate students
		at Loughborough University.
