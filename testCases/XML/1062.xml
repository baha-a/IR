		  The referee system in science involves the systematic use of judges to
		assess the acceptability of manuscripts submitted for publication.  The
		referee is thus an example of status-judges who are charged with evaluating
		the quality of role-performance in a social system.  They are found in
		every institutional sphere.  Other kinds of status-judges include teachers
		assessing the quality of work by students (and, as a recent institutional
		change, students officially assessing the quality of performance by teachers),
		critics in the arts, supervisors in industry and coaches and managers in
		sports.  Status-judges are integral to any system of social control through
		their evaluation of role-performance and their allocation of rewards for
		that performance.  They influence the motivation to maintain or to raise
		standards of performance.
