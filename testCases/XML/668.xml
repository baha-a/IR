		  Many methods for the coding of chemical structures 
		have been described in the literature.	Some methods code
		the compound only partially; typical of these are the
		methods using descriptor codes.  Other methods, among
		which the so-called ciphers are prominent, code
		compounds exhaustively.  All these methods require
		cerebral effort; that is, a chemist is needed who must 
		have learned the rules of the code, and who must known how
		to dismember correctly each structure to be coded.  A
		disadvantage of code designations of structures is, furthermore,
		that they are not generally understood by chemists.  No
		advantages accrue to the chemist from knowing how to
		generate and how to interpret a chemical code.	Codes are
		needed only for the mechanical manipulation of chemical
		structures.  Clearly then, if the coding of chemical compounds
		could be accomplished automatically this automatic conversion would
		relieve the chemist of considerable burden.
