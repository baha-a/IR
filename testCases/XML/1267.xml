		This book describes exhaustive classification of the declensional types (noun,
		adjective, participle, mineral, pronoun) in modern Russian literary language
		and rules of formation for all word-forms of any declinable Russian word.
		The Description of the Russian declensional system which given in present
		monography has great importance, on the one hand, for such practical problems
		as the teaching Russian and the development of automatic Russian text
		synthesis; and, on the another hand, for a general-theory of declension and for
		the typological study of Slavic languages.
