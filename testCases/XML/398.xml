		    What are the needs being served by informal communication?
		What can be done about giving informal communication, without
		destroying its function for the active researcher, certain of
		the advantages of formal communication, such as, general
		accessibility, permanence, etc.?  How can formal channels be
		manipulated to take on the characteristics of informal
		communication?  To cast light on these questions the present
		paper examines the role of informal and formal channels within
		the overall system of scientific dissemination in psychology,
		considers the special advantages of informal communication,
		and outlines certain relations between informal and formal
		channels.  In a final section of the paper, two experiments
		in scientific communication are described; one experiment being
		built about an innovation that attempts to "informalize" formal
		channels while the other is built about another innovation that,
		in general, attempts to "formalize" an informal channel.
