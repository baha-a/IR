	<title>Austerity, Technology, and Resource Sharing: Research Libraries Face the Future	</title>

		  During the last two decades academic libraries, in
		parallel with their parent institutions, experienced the
		greatest period of growth and affluence that they have
		ever known.  The watchword was "more" - more money,
		more books and journals, more staff, more space, and
		more technology.  Many new research libraries were
		created, and those that already existed experienced
		unprecedented growth.  Although libraries got more of
		everything during those years, they still could not keep pace
		with the growth of new fields of research, new doctoral
		programs, and the increasing production of books and
		journals.  Two decades of affluence not only failed to help
		solve the many problems that were brought on by
		exponential growth - they exacerbated them.
