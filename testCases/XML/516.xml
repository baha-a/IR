		   In a structured data base, such as that obtained when information is indexed
		in a format including explicit relations, retrieval of all relevant items in
		response to a question may, in some cases, be restricted by technicalities of 
		the structure.. Condensations in the form of logical jumps, or the omission of 
		a concept with one relation out of a string of three concepts with two 
		interstitial relations, have been investigated by two different methods, in 
		order to overcome one of these technicalities.. Thirty-two rules are proposed
		which could permit the automatic condensation of either of both the stored 
		information and the question, when the concepts and relations are in the form 
		of linear or string display.. Nine rules are proposed for condensation of 
		angular structures.. Other type of logical jump and abbreviation are discussed, 
		together with related studies of expansions and inference steps..
