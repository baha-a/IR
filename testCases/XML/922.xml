		    The major conclusions and recommendations of the study which follows are:
		  That the catalogs of The Research Libraries of the New York Public Library be
		divided chronologically at the earliest possible date;
		  That the present (or retrospective) Public Catalog be reproduced 
		photographically in book form;
		  That the future (or prospective) catalogs be produced in a combination of 
		card and book form from a store of machine-readable data;
		  That a Central Serial Record be created to contain acquisition information, 
		cataloging and holdings data, and bindery records for all serial publications 
		in The Research Libraries.
