		  The previous papers in this series have discussed
		the concept of a index of permuted Wiswesser chemical
		line notations, the significance of a QUICK-SCAN area,
		and simple methods for preparing this type of index for a
		small index file of compounds (up to ca. 5000).  It has
		been pointed out that the preparation of a index for a large
		number of compounds would require the use of a computer.
		This is the subject of this paper.
