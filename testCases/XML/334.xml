		        Librarians are known for their organizational work
		with recorded knowledge.  Information storage and retrieval
		are two well-known, basic functions associated with this
		work.  A search of the literature of library science reveals
		that these functions have not been examined to any significant
		degree from the users' point of view.  This is true in regard
		to library catalogs and library subject headings.
