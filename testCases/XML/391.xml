	<title>Factors in the Transfer of Technology	</title>

		  The strong correlation between the scope and depth of this country's
		research and development activities and the vigor and the growth of its
		industrial plant is today a widely accepted fact.  Government expenditures
		for research and development have increased from a modest
		annual rate of $200 million some thirty years ago to $17 billion today.
		The research budgets of the private sector of the economy, which were
		almost miniscule in the 1930's, total approximately $8 billion today.
		These expenditures have had their many tangible and visible results,
		ranging from nylon and antibiotics to radar and solid state electronics,
		but what is not so generally appreciated is the additional product
		represented by the increasing inventory of ideas and new knowledge
		whose application, for the most part, is still a potential one.  The
		sophisticated and often urgent nature of some of the larger products in
		which we engage today, which require vast research expenditures to
		find the efficient way, or the economical way, or the safe way, or the
		most accurate way to accomplish some end purpose, also produces an
		increase in the national level of scientific and technological competence
		that has not yet been transferred into the civilian economy.  The
		value of the technical ideas now stored and awaiting application can
		be estimated as a value many times larger than the annual rate of
		billions of dollars invested in the effort it took to develop this increased
		technical capability.  As a national resource for underwriting further
		economic and industrial development, this technical inventory is a
		factor of major importance.
