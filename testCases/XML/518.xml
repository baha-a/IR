	<title>A Bayesian Approach to Interactive Retrieval	</title>
	<author>Tague, Jean M.	</author>
	<text>
		   This paper presents a probabilistic model for interactive retrieval.. 
		Specifically, it applies the principles of Bayesian statistical decision theory:
		(1) the use of both prior (subjective) and sample information about the
		relationship of document descriptions to query relevance, and (2) maximization 
		of the expected value of a utility function, to the problem of optimally 
		restructuring a search strategy in an interactive environment..
