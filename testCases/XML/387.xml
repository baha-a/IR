		    The study is a result of a theory of librarianship which has been in the
		process of maturation for more than a quarter century of teaching and
		administration, first at the University of Chicago, and subsequently at Western
		Reserve University, now Case Western Reserve University, and which has
		been elaborated in essays and addresses as the inquiry progressed.
		    My purpose has been to explore the role of the library as it contributes
		to the total communication system in society and the meaning of that role
		for the library profession, and having determined the requirements of that
		role to identify those which are appropriately met by graduate professional
		education.  Therefore, the inquiry begins with a consideration of the
		communication system within the individual as related to his physiological,
		neurological, and psychological structure, and its meaning for learning and
		reading patterns and characteristics.  The study then progresses to an
		exposition of the cultural environment and its communication system in society,
		together with the place of the library in it.
