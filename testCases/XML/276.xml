		   The accessibility of the card catalog seems to be inversely proportional to
		the complexity of its arrangement.. A catalog divided into author-title and
		subject sequence simplifies the filing order of cards and facilitates the use 
		of each catalog.. It is argued here that a three-way division into author, 
		title, and subject catalogs will further augment these advantages.. In this 
		paper a separation of the title catalog at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee
		library is described and evaluated..
