		  During the past three hundred years the journal article has become
		the main institutionalized form of formal scholarly communication.
		Potential contributions to a discipline acquire credibility because
		they have been published in a reputable journal (Zuckerman and Merton,
		1971).  Who published what and where therefore becomes a central 
		question in the understanding of scholarly, and in particular
		scientific, disciplines.  There have recently been a number of
		investigations concerning the career of such publications.  This
		career, I suggest, can be conceptualized into three stages.
		1) Pre-publication.  Here the scholar writes the article, circulates
		it to colleagues and perhaps presents it at formal and informal
		meetings (Garvey, Lin and Nelson, 1971).
		2) Publication.  Here the article is submitted to one or more journals
		for publication consideration (Zuckerman and Merton, 1971).
		3) Post-publication.  Here colleagues either ignore the published
		article or reward it through citations to it in their own work.  The
		practice of citing a colleague's work is perhaps the main way in which
		scholars indicate what they consider to be a contribution to their discipline.
