		  In June 1965, the Acquisitions Department of The University of
		Michigan Library began using a computer-based system for ordering
		books and other library materials.  This is the beginning of an over-all
		automated system for the Acquisitions Department and was designed
		with the assistance of Robert O. Kindt, Systems Analyst from the
		University's Office of Management Services.  Preliminary work on the
		automated system was begun in late 1963, and in September, 1964.  Mr.
		Kindt was assigned to the University Library on a full-time basis.  After
		the preliminary proposal was drafted, cost and feasibility studies were
		made.  Current (i.e., 1964) volume and costs were compared with anticipated
		volume and costs in 1968 and 1975 for both manual and automated systems.
