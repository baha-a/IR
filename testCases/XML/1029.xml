		  The kind of study presented in this monograph has not as yet
		won a wide following among working historians.  On the whole
		their interest has remained with the larger units of social
		action: the region, the class, the party, the ethnic or religious
		group.  It has been left to the so-called behavioral sciences -
		anthropology, sociology, psychology - to demonstrate the fundamental
		importance of the smallest and most intimate of all group environments,
		the family.
