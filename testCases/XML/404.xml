	<text>
		  This guide is an introduction to the Library of Congress Classification; as
		such, it does not include instructions for every subclass or table, but attempts
		to provide the reader with an understanding of the characteristics of the
		classification, the arrangement within the classes, the format of the schedules
		and tables, and special problems of use and notation.  The reader should trace
		the analysis of each example of classing through the pages from the L.C. 
		schedule provided in the guide.  It is important to remind the reader that a
		thorough study of each class schedule in addition to the recommended readings
		is essential.  The author realizes that many imperfections may be present in
		this guide and will appreciate suggestions for changes from readers.
