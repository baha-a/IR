	<title>Conceptual Design of an Automated National Library System	</title>

	<text>
		    This work describes a conceptual design of an automated
		national library system.  The design is "conceptual" in that it is
		intended to show the feasibility of a system concept rather than
		provide a detailed engineering design.  The design concerns an
		automated national library system but does not attempt to automate
		all parts of the system.  It is primarily concerned with the functions of
		bibliographic searching, acquisition, circulation, and cataloging.  If
		these functions can be economically automated, the major problems
		associated with our information explosion will be solved.
