	<title>Standardized Costs for Automated Library Systems	</title>
	<author>Jacob, Mary Ellen L.	</author>
	<text>
		   Costs of the automated library systems as currently given in published 
		reports tend to be misleading and confusing.. It is necessary to have a clear 
		understanding of how they were derived before any comparisons can be made..
		Clearly defined costs in terms of time units are more meaningful than straight 
		dollar costs and can be used as one means of comparison among various system 
		designs and as guidelines for the design of new systems..
