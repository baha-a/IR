		   The model of a technical information system described there by Dr. Kessler 
		involves a working literature taken from twenty-one journals in the field of
		physics.. The system, designed and constructed at the Massachusetts Institute of
		Technology as a prototype operating in a realistic test environment, uses 
		remote consoles having access to a time-sharing computer facility.. Programs
		have been developed for a large variety of search and processing techniques in
		real time as well as for delayed output.. The work is supported by the National
		Science Foundation and in part by Project MAC, the experimental computer 
		facility at MIT which is sponsored by the Advanced Research Projects Agency..
