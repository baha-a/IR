		  My objective in this work has been to try to get at the fundamental
		aspects of the elements and media of scientific and technological
		communication and to describe the critical issues involving them as well
		as the opportunities and techniques for exploiting them which hopefully
		could aid both the "users" and the "handlers" of these important resources.
