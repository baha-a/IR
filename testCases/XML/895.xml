	<title>Design Equations for Retrieval System Based on the Swets Model	</title>

		   Swets's theory of information retrieval allows the threads of document
		weighting formulae, probabilistic measures of effectiveness, and management 
		theory to be woven into a coherent pattern.. Benefits of the theory are the
		beginnings of a quantitative description of retrieval languages, a clear 
		distinction between retrieval 'systems' and 'language', a recognition that 
		retrieval performance can be tailored to suit individual needs in a systematic 
		way, and confirmation that question Generality is a pivotal feature of the 
		retrieval process.. The hypotheses involved are still in need of rigorous 
		experimental testing..
