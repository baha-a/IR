	<title>The Area Specialist Bibliographer: an inquiry into his role 	</title>
	<author>Stuart, R.D.	</author>
	<text>
		  It is the intent of this volume to develop a model designed
		to eliminate present difficulties and ambiguities and
		to improve administrative procedures for future development
		of area programs.  This will be accomplished by giving
		some indication of the climate of opinion toward area specialist
		bibliographers and by isolating factors which influence
		these opinions.  These attitudes will be presented by the
		perceptions of area bibliographers toward their role and the
		expectations of faculty and library administrators toward that
		role.  The bibliographer's academic, professional, and
		educational experience will be examined in this framework.
