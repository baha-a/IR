	<title>The 'Half-Life' of Periodical Literature:  Apparent and Real Obsolescence	</title>
	<author>Line, M.B.	</author>
	<text>
		  The expression 'half-life', borrowed from physics, has appeared
		quite frequently in the literature on documentation since 1960, when an
		article by Burton and Kebler on The 'half-life' of some scientific and technical
		literatures was published, although it had certainly been used previously.
		Burton and Kebler point out that literature becomes obsolescent rather than
		disintegrating (as in its original meaning), so that 'half-life' means 'half the
		active life', and this is commonly understood as meaning the time during
		which one-half of the currently active literature was published.  Numerous
		studies have been carried out, mainly by the analysis of citations, to establish
		obsolescence rates of the literature of different subjects.  Bourne points out
		that different studies have given widely different results, so that many of the
		'half-life' figures reported are not valid beyond the particular sample of
		literature or users surveyed; certainly they cannot be used as accurate
		measures for discriminating between different subject-fields.
