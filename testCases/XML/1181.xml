	<text>
		   The different explanations of the nature of the information problems now
		facing science and their causes are cited and shown to be debatable.. It is
		necessary to give a definition of "information crisis", this widely used 
		concept in informatics and the science of science.. The author suggests one
		such definition, which reflects the specific historical nature of the possible
		manifestations of the crisis.. The "cumulativistic" concept of the progress of
		science is criticized as it rules out the possibility of finding the true
		causes of the information crisis.. The major cause is asserted to lie with the
		nature of the contemporary social production.. An approach to studying into
		the origins of the problem is suggested..
