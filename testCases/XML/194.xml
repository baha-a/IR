	<title>The Evaluation of Published Indexes and Abstract Journals:      Criteria and Possible Procedures	</title>
	<author>Lancaster, F.W.	</author>
	<text>
		   This paper describes possible criteria by which the effectiveness of a
		published index  may be evaluated and suggest procedures that might be used to
		conduct an evaluation of a published index.. The procedures were developed for
		the National Library of Medicine and relate specifically to the recurring
		bibliographies produced by MEDLARS in various specialized areas of
		biomedicine.. The methods described should, however, be applicable to other
		printed indexes and abstract journals..
		   Factors affecting the performance  of a published index are also discussed
		and some research projects relevant to the evaluation of published indexes are
		reviewed..
