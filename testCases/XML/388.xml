		  The use of classification in libraries is traditional and its value is
		appreciated.  For documentation and information retrieval in
		general, other techniques such as alphabetical indexing and
		machine selection are also available.  That classification is of
		value in information retrieval as well as in book arrangement is,
		however, made evident in two ways.  First, to achieve consistency
		and subtlety in alphabetical indexing and machine selection
		designers of such retrieval systems find the need to introduce
		classificatory techniques.  Second, there is a continuing demand
		for the construction of special classifications for detailed arrangement
		and cataloguing of documents in restricted but intensively
		cultivated fields of knowledge.
		  It is to help meet these demands, particularly the second, that
		this guide has been prepared.  The techniques of detailed depth
		classification have been greatly developed during the past decade,
		and instruments of much greater subtlety and efficiency than the
		traditional 'tree-of-knowledge' schemes can now be designed.
		These developments have been reported mainly as research papers
		in a variety of library journals and are often made unnecessarily
		difficult to follow by the use of unfamiliar terminology.
		There is a need for a more simply written and more readily
		available practical guide to the use of the newer techniques of
		classification.
