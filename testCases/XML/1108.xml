	<author>Morozova, N.A.	</author>
	<text>
		   Methods of analysis of the VINITI abstract journals are described as applied
		for measuring the exhaustivity and speed of coverage of patents; the
		feasibility and efficiency of using the abstract journals of VINITI composition
		of the patent file of a plant, subject- or name-based patent searches, etc..
		The mean time lags in signalization of the USSR patents in the abstract
		journals are 6 to 7 months, British patent -- 6 to 8 months, West German -- 10
		to 12, French 12, and US -- 12 to 13 months..  Some improvements of the
		abstract journals as source in information on latest world inventions are
		suggested..
