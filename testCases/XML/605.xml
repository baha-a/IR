		   A mathematical model is presented which explains the observed exponential 
		growth rates of citations and references in a scientific discipline.. The 
		independent variables are the growth rate of the number of articles published 
		and the decay rate of citation of old literature.. It is shown how the 
		parameters of the model can be estimated..
