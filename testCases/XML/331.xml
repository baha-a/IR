	<title>Computerized Library Catalogs: Their Growth, Cost and Utility	</title>
	<author>Dolby, J.L.	</author>
	<text>
		  This book is a slightly modified form of a report on computerized
		library catalogs prepared for the Office of Education of the United States
		Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (Contract OEC-1-7-
		071182-5013).  It consists of seven chapters.  The first poses the problems
		that have been studied, introduces background material to facilitate an
		understanding of their significance, and presents our conclusions and
		general recommendations.  The remaining chapters belong to one of two
		parts, depending on whether their principle concern is the utility or the
		cost of computeerized library catalogs.  Because the problem of utility is the
		more speculative of the two, it has been placed in the second part.
