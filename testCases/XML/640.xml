	<title>The Scientific Premises of Information Science	</title>
	<author>Rosenberg, Victor	</author>
	<text>
		   Throughout my years of work as an information scientist I have been
		plagued by a personal and professional sense of doubt with respect to the
		field.. A central theme of every conference that I have attended related
		to:  "What is information science?" Or "Is information science a science?"
		In this paper I hope to take these questions head on.. I must begin by
		saying that I do take information science seriously as a science.. I see
		it as the quest for understanding of the nature of information and
		man's interaction with it.. That we lack so much in this quest for
		understanding is the greatest challenge of the science..
		   I intend to explore the tradition, or world view, bearing on the
		scientific study of information.. The currently prevalent world view is
		the scientific tradition which extends from the Enlightenment to
		the present.. I also intend to look critically at what I perceive
		to be te premises underlying most of our current efforts to understand
		the phenomenon of information.. The criticism will by necessity be
		speculative.. I intend to stick my neck out, not because I can prove
		my assertions, but because I believe these ideas must be discussed..
