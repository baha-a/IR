	<title>Experiments in Book Indexing by Computer	</title>

		   The most challenging task in preparing an index to a book is to select all 
		and only those terms that are related to the text and are useful for relevance 
		purposes.. While a knowledgeable human can make the selection on an intuitive 
		basis, automatic indexing requires a precise operational criterion for defining 
		and selecting good and useful index terms.. Two principles of selection are 
		proposed:specification and selection of useful terms, and specification and 
		exclusion of useless terms.. Because of the nebulous nature and meaning of
		"good index terms", and the difficulties involved in devising machine algorithms
		for their selection, this research in automatic indexing is based on the 
		principle of excluding useless terms.. Even so,fully automatic indexing was not 
		achieved in this study.. Single words proved to be little value as index terms..
		Multiple word terms were generated by the computer, but no algorithm could 
		successfully eliminate the useless phrases.. Final selection had to be made by 
		the experimenter.. A comprehensive and useful book index was achieved by using 
		machine-aided rather than fully automated indexing techniques..
