	<title>Progress in Documentation:Research in User Behaviour in University Libraries	</title>
	<author>Ford, G.	</author>
	<text>
		  The task of the librarian is to achieve his library's objectives.  A
		simplistic statement, perhaps, but it is rare that a library's objectives
		are defined in any terms other than the broadest - for example, 'to meet
		the needs of its users'.  In fact, the definition of objectives in any
		service organization is likely to be an iterative process, but the
		explicit commitment to users' needs (however mystical this concept may
		be) requires the librarian to examine users' behaviour as a first step
		to determining policy.  Since a complete state-of-the-art in user 
		behaviour would fill a substantial book, this survey is restricted to
		drawing together some threads of research of potential application in
		university libraries.  Methodological problems are not discussed here,
		since these are adequately reviewed elsewhere.
