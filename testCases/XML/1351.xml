	<title>The Special Cataloguing	</title>

		  We feel, meanwhile, that many materials can be covered by general
		or representative principles and rules.  The content of this book can
		be viewed as of two types.  Firstly, the first and last chapters deal with
		special materials in general, the former dealing with basic cataloguing
		principles and problems, and the latter with the ultimate application
		of such principles as manifested by the concept of the multi-media
		catalogue and as aided by the computer.  Secondly, in between come
		chapters dealing with individual categories of materials in detail.  Each
		category receives two types of treatment.  First, the problems of both
		approaches and description are examined as they apply to the particular
		medium.  Second, the solutions put forward by representative codes are
		summarized and commented upon.
