		  A thesaurus can be defined as a structured vocabulary for use in information
		storage and retrieval systems.
		  Three parts of this definition need further elaboration:
		  1. A vocabulary is a collection of terms.
		  2. The structure of a vocabulary can be described as a set of relationships
		     between terms.
		  3. Utilization of a thesaurus in an information system involves a set of
		     rules which take into account the characteristics of the system.
