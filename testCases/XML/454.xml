	<title>Information Analysis and Retrieval	</title>

		    Therefore the purpose of this book remains the same as that of Textbook on
		Mechanized Information Retrieval - to teach basics to those who have had no
		previous exposure either to the field or to computers, or both.  Therefore,
		the action is slowed to the point where the logical principles of information
		retrieval systems are laid bare.  Other books have been published that emphasize
		computer programming - this one does not.
