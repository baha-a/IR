		     Most librarians mark the beginning of modern librarianship
		from the founding of the American Library Association in 1876 and
		the appearance on the national library scene of such dynamic and
		controversial figures as Melvil Dewey and Charles Ammi Cutter.
		     But in doing so, they overlook an extremely significant era in
		the history of our profession, for the quarter century preceding the
		1876 meeting in Philadelphia was one characterized by great advances
		in the field of American librarianship.  This period of growth was to
		have considerable influence on the course of library development in
		America after 1876.  To ignore the third quarter of the nineteenth
		century is to risk misinterpreting the pivotal post-1876 era,
		and in this time of reappraisal, it seems particularly appropriate
		and useful to focus our attention on the years preceding the founding
		of the American Library Association.
