	<author>Prewitt, Barbara G.	</author>
	<text>
		   A comparison of the most used features of System Development Corporation's
		ORBIT and Lockheed's DIALOG systems is made, especially in reference to 
		conducting  searchers of Chemical Abstracts Condensates..Many of the operations
		are similar in nature.. However the capabilities are sufficiently  different 
		that an experienced searcher can select the system which gives the best 
		results..
