	<title>An Analysis of the Universal Decimal Classification as a Term System for Nuclear Science and Technology	</title>
	<author>Stueart, Robert D.	</author>
	<text>
		   Explores the possibilities of merging the terminology of the Universal
		Decimal Classification System with that of a term system - Engineers Point
		Council's Thesaurus - for nuclear science and technology.. Concludes, from the
		evidence presented, that UDC can be effectively used as a term system.. Proposes
		that the two systems coordinate the terms and merge a major thesaurus (EJC) with
		an effective classification scheme of international scope (UDC) to provide a
		needed tool in the area of classification and documentation..
