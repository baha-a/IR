		     A funny thing happened on the way
		to the biggest building boom in library
		history.  Book collections grew faster
		than the new space to hold them, so when
		the boom was over the aggregate space
		problem of academic libraries was a little
		worse than it was at the beginning.
		     During the roughly eight-year span
		of the rise and fall of the boom, some 570
		new or expanded library buildings sprang
		up on the campuses of four-year and
		graduate institutions around the nation.
