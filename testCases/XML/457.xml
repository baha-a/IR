		  In a day when it is hard enough in most fields of science to
		keep abreast of new and non-redundant literature, the
		publication of collected papers, like the estate of holy
		matrimony, is something not to be undertaken 'unadvisedly,
		lightly or wantonly'.  In the present case it would not have been
		considered at all but for the kindly initiative of my respected
		friend Professor Roman Jakobson, whose persistent encouragement
		alone overcame that distaste which most of us feel
		for our ten- to twenty-year-old productions and brought this
		first volume to the point of no return.  It is true that these
		exploratory papers were scattered among an unconscionably 
		awkward selection of publications for anyone wanting to
		follow them up.  On the other hand, as most of them were
		written for specific occasions, each of which demanded some
		rehearsal of points covered in earlier essays, the resulting
		repetitiveness presented a special problem.  With occasional
		exceptions, redundancy could have been eliminated only
		at the cost of mutilating individual papers.  The solution
		adopted has been to leave almost all repetitive passages
		intact, offsetting in small print those that can be skipped
		without loss by readers of the earlier chapters.  Where some
		comment has seemed necessary, by way of foreword or 
		postscript to the original papers, the passages added have
		been italicized.
