		   The Computer Search Center (CSC) at IIT Research Institute (IITRI) provides
		information from computer-readable data bases to users in industry, government
		and universities.. The center was designed to meet user needs by providing a 
		variety of services from multiple data bases with minimal restrictions and a
		high degree of flexibility.. A new modular machine-independent PL/1 software
		system was developed for handling virtually any bibliographic-type base.. CSC
		have run at nine different computer facilities with different: hardware,
		computer models, versions of OS, peripherals of the PL/1 compiler.. All data
		bases are converted by preprocessors to a standard IITRI format which employs
		a directory and character string type of the structure..
		   User oriented profile features include: full free form Boolean logic with 
		any degree of nesting; search terms may be any data element on a data base; 
		search terms may be single words, multi-word terms, phrases, or term fragments;
		full truncation capabilities; optional sort of author, citation number, or 
		weight; and optional printing of output on 5x8 cards, multilith masters, paper,
		or tape.. User aids were developed for each data base to assist in profile and
		monitoring.. They include: search manuals, truncation guides, term frequency 
		list and KLIC indexes..
		   Research is conducted and statistics maintained to study, monitor, and 
		improve Center components including data bases, user satisfaction, systems,
		personnel functions and services.. The many advantages of computerized 
		retrieval, which are the raison d'etre for the center, include: coverage,
		thoroughness, consistency, interdisciplinariness, recall, speed, regularity,
		file preparation and cost effectiveness..
