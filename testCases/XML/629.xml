		   This article deals with the promotion of information services, specifically
		the formation and subsequent evaluation of different promotional programs
		for selective dissemination of information (SDI) services provided by the
		Mechanized Information Center (MIC) at the Ohio State University.. Three
		programs -- opinion leadership, "blitz," and telephone solicitation -- 
		were developed.. Data were collected to show, for each of the programs:  
		(1) the level of market penetration achieved; (2) the level of user
		satisfaction generated from the service; (3) the effect in terms of
		influence, of the various media employed; and (4) cost effectiveness..
		Data analysis focused on a determination of the most effective methods
		to promote SDI services..
