	<title>Guide to Reference Books	</title>

		  The fundamental principles of reference work remain
		more or less constant through the years, but the rapid
		expansion of the publication of reference books in all
		fields makes essential a careful selection to fit the needs
		of each library.  The purpose of this volume is to list
		reference books basic to research - general and special -
		and thus to serve as: (1) a reference manual for the
		library assistant, research worker, or other user of
		library resources; (2) a selection aid for the librarian; and
		(3) a textbook for the student, who, either in library
		school, training class, or college course in bibliography,
		is pursuing a systematic study of reference books.
		  The needs of these types of users have influenced the
		organization and make-up of this volume, in that the
		requirements of the first two groups have made the
		manual more comprehensive than it might have been if
		intended for a textbook only, while the introductions to
		sections and many of the annotations have been provided
		particularly for the library school student.
