	<title>User Resistance to Microforms in the Research Library	</title>
	<author>Salmon, S.R.	</author>
	<text>
		  Microforms enjoy only limited acceptance in research libraries, largely
		because of user resistance.  A growing number of published studies indicate
		that improper production, inadequate bibliographic access, lack of 
		standardization, defects in equipment design, maintenance problems,
		poor environments for microform usage, and certain inherent characteristics
		of the microforms themselves all combine to make their use inconvenient.
		Solutions to most of these problems have existed for some time, but the
		microform industry has been slow to correct them.  Some positive developments
		have occurred in the last two years, but the major problems remain.
