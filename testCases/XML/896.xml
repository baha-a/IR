		  This study was undertaken to meet more fully the demands for
		improved and expanded training of library personnel, especially at the
		middle and upper levels, occasioned by the rapidly changing roles and
		functions of libraries as they try to adapt to the vast social, economic,
		and technological changes currently in progress.  The rise to a higher
		level of required skills and competencies - often new - has brought about
		an urgent need for improved training beyond the first professional
		degree at the post-master's level.  The basic purpose of this research is
		curriculum development at the post-master's level that will equip the
		middle- and upper-level personnel in libraries for the changes confronting
		them.  Although it would be possible to restructure the master's program
		and add the courses that this study shows a need for, that alternative
		has not been pursued for two reasons: a fairly stable master's curriculum
		is widely accepted and institutionalized and, more important, the new
		courses are designed for a different group of students - experienced
		librarians.
