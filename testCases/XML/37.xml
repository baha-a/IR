		A quantitative estimate is made of the magnitude of the
		world's scientific and technical journal literature problem.
		Using a number of basic sources of statistical information,
		a composite picture is established to show such things as
		the total volume, linguistic and national origins, breakdown
		by subject field, and degree of coverage by the abstracting
		and indexing services.
