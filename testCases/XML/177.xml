	<title>Automation in Libraries	</title>
	<author>Kimber, R.T.	</author>
	<text>
		  My purpose in writing this book has been to try to give an understanding
		of what automated systems can do in libraries today.  I have limited
		myself strictly to those areas which are commonly termed "library
		housekeeping" - the processes of book ordering and cataloguing,
		periodicals accessioning and circulation control, whose purpose is to
		make a library into an efficient machine for acquiring, storing, and
		disseminating knowledge and information.  These are the processes
		which can be automated here and now to improve the quality of
		service which a library can give to its readers.  I hope that the
		descriptions and explanations given here will be of assistance to librarians
		in developing appropriate automated systems in their own libraries.
