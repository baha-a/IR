		    This book deals with the simplest of the three corrective measures -
		the improvement of the document retrieval system.  There are different
		ways and means of accomplishing this, and these methods of improving
		the organization and retrieval of personal document collections are the
		principal topics to be covered.  The book is addressed primarily to the
		researcher in any subject field who desires to improve the index to his
		document collection or start an index to his document collection but does
		not quite know how to go about it.  An index is herein defined as a
		systematic organization of a collection of documents or data.  There are
		indexes to various types of document and data collections, and there are
		various types of indexes.  Examples of familiar indexes are indexes to
		individual books, to collections of books (the card catalog in a library),
		to the contents of journals or periodicals (for example, the Reader's Guide
		to Periodical Literature), to collections of facts (for example, a telephone
		directory), or to numeric data (such as physical constants of a group
		of compounds or numeric data collected in a questionnaire study).
