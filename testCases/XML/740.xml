		   A study was conducted to compare the comprehensiveness of searches performed
		using Systems Development Corporation's (SDC) Chemcon data base and keyword 
		indexes of Chemical Abstracts.. It was concluded that, in most cases, a 
		computer search yielded at least as many relevant references as did a manual 
		search.. However, in the case of very general search questions, results from 
		manual searches were much more satisfactory..
