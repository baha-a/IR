	<author>Fair, J.	</author>
	<text>
		  Part I dealt with the selection of a microtext manager and
		with procedural consideration in the acquisition process.
		Part II continues the discussion about acquisitions, including
		considerations of format, variation, and reliability of
		publisher-supplied project information.  The Library's
		search for an adequate system of bibliographic control is
		examined.  Cataloging methods, classification schemes, and
		hardcopy guides and indexes are discussed as components
		of bibliographic control.
