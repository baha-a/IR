		  Nearly twenty-five years ago it occurred to me that we might gain 
		considerable insight into the mainsprings of human behavior if we viewed it
		purely as a natural phenomenon like everything else in the universe, and if
		we studied it with the same dispassionate objectivity with which one is wont
		to study, say, the social behavior of bees, or the nestbuilding habits of
		birds.  The present book reports the results of the extended inquiry that
		ensued in the course of those years, and which led to the disclosure of
		some fundamental principles that seem to govern important aspects of our
		behavior, both as individuals and as members of social groups.
