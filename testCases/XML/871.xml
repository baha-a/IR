	<text>
		   Two research keys (4,5 and 3,3) are analyzed using a probability formula on
		a bibliographic file of 857,725 records.. Assuming random requests by record 
		permits the creation of a predictive model which more closely approximates 
		the actual behavior of a search and retrieval system as determined by a usage 
		survey..
