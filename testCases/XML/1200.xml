	<author>Shockley, W.	</author>
	<text>
		  In the following pages a co-winner of the 1956 Nobel Prize in Physics
		presents a novel study of one of today's most precious commodities -
		scientific productivity.  The author not only measures the variations
		that exist between different research workers, he also explains these
		differences and draws some specific conclusions about the relationship
		of salary to productivity.  PROCEEDINGS readers will find this an
		especially timely ad significant discussion, particularly in view of
		the present widespread concern about manpower shortages and proper
		utilization of scientific personnel.
