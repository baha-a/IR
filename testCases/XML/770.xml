	<title>Tests on Abstracts Journals	</title>

		  The amount of scientific and technical information published 
		annually in the form of journal articles, conference papers, reports, theses,
		patents, and books now greatly exceeds, in every field of interest, the
		amount which may be scanned by a scientist wishing to keep himself completely
		up to date in his own subject.  For a scientist wishing to inform himself of
		new developments in neighbouring subject-fields the problem is
		even greater.  Consequently, either the scientist reconciles himself to the
		knowledge that he is not aware of all relevant information in his field or
		he places increasingly more reliance on such bibliographic tools as are
		available to guide him towards the relevant literature.
		  First among such tools is the abstracts journal.
