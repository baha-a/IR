	<title>The Social Construction of RealityA Treatise on the Sociology of Knowledge	</title>
	<author>Armor, D.J.	</author>
	<text>
		  The present volume is intended as a systematic, theoretical treatise
		in the sociology of knowledge.  It is not intended, therefore, to give
		a historical survey of the development of this discipline, or to engage
		in exegesis of various figures in this other other developments in
		sociological theory, or even to show how a synthesis may be achieved
		between several of these figures and developments.  Nor is there any
		polemic intent here.  Critical comments on other theoretical positions
		have been introduced (not in the text, but in the Notes) only
		where they may serve to clarify the present argument.
