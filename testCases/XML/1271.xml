	<title>Is a Scientific Revolution Taking Place in Psychology?	</title>
	<author>Palermo, D.S.	</author>
	<text>
		  My plan in this paper is to try to apply to the field of experimental
		psychology the analysis of the characteristics of science (and, more
		particularly, the structure of scientific revolutions) as conceptualized by
		T.S. Kuhn.  Kuhn has not been accepted without criticism, but that need not
		prevent us from using his book as a point of departure for discussion.  I assume
		that the reader will be familiar with Kuhn's analysis,so that only a sketchy
		summary of his position is necessary.  I will then take a brief look at some of
		the history of psychology, with special emphasis upon the major tenets of
		behaviorism.  Finally, I will advance some evidence to suggest that we may well
		be living in an era of revolution within psychology (as well as without).
