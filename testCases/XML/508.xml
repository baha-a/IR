		   We express the conviction that on-line reference retrieval will largely 
		replace the present tape driven system in a few years.. We describe the design
		criteria of such an on-line system based on our experience of a pilot system 
		which has been operational for 2 years, emphasizing the importance of
		minimizing the number of disk accesses.. We recommend the use of hash coding 
		for searching in a thesaurus and point out that the user of an on-line system 
		should use the most precise terms first and the common terms last - the 
		opposite of the procedure in a manual search..
