	<title>Error-correcting Codes	</title>

		  Several major developments have contributed to the rapid emergence
		of the field of error-correcting codes over the past two decades.
		Externally, the cost of solid-state electronic devices has decreased almost as
		dramatically as their size.  This has stimulated the development of digital
		computers and peripheral devices and this, in turn, has caused a dramatic
		increase in the volume of data communicated between such
		machines.  The intolerance of computing systems to error, and in some
		cases the inherently critical nature of the data demand the use of either
		error-free facilities or some type of error-detecting or correcting code in
		the terminal devices.  In many cases the latter approach is the more 
		economical.
