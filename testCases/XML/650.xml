	<title>Relative Effectiveness of Titles, Abstracts, and Subject Headings for Machine Retrieval from the COMPENDEX Services	</title>
	<author>Byrne, Jerry R.	</author>

		   We have investigated the relative merits of searching on titles, subject 
		headings, abstracts, free-language terms, and combinations of these elements..
		The COMPENDEX data base  was used for this study since it contained all of the
		data elements of interest.. In general, the results obtained from the 
		experiments indicate that, as expected, titles alone are not satisfactory for 
		efficient retrieval.. The combination of titles and abstracts came the closest 
		to 100% retrieval, with searching of abstracts alone doing almost as well..
		Indexer input, although necessary for 100% retrieval in almost all cases, was
		found to be relatively unimportant..
