	<title>Formal Languages and Their Relation to Automata	</title>
	<author>Hopcroft, J.E.  	</author>
	<text>
		  This book presents the theory of formal languages as a coherent theory
		and makes explicit its relationship to automata.  The book begins with an
		explanation of the notion of a finite description of a language.  The
		fundamental descriptive device - the grammar - is explained, as well as
		its three major subclasses - regular, context-free, and context-sensitive
		grammars.  The context-free grammars are treated in detail, and such topics
		as normal forms, derivation trees, and ambiguity are covered.  Four types of
		automata equivalent to the four types of grammars are described.  These
		automata are the finite automaton, the pushdown automaton, the linear
		bounded automaton, and the Turing machine.  The Turing machine is covered in
		detail, and unsolvability of the halting problem shown.  The book concludes
		with certain advanced topics in language theory - closure properties,
		computational complexity, deterministic pushdown automata, LR(k) grammars,
		stack automata, and decidability.
