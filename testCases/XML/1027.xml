		  This study was commissioned by the Committee on Linguistics in
		Documentation of the Federation Internationale de Documentation (FID).
		It is concerned with the linguistic aspects of information science, and
		in particular with the linguistic components of document analysis,
		description, and retrieval.  We have attempted to relate linguistics
		and information science by considering the theories and techniques
		linguistics has to offer, and how far these have been, or could be, 
		exploited by information scientists.  We have examined these questions
		within the context of automated language processing and automated 
		documentation.  The use of computers for linguistic operations presents
		special challenges as well as interesting possibilities, and we have
		chosen to approach the field from this particular point of view.
