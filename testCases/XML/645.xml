	<title>Creation and Use of Citation Data Bases: A Modest Proposal	</title>
	<author>Waters, Samuel T.	</author>
	<text>
		   Improvement in the production and use of citations to research literature 
		calls for coordination of activities by a number of abstracting and indexing 
		services.. The Ohio College Library Center (OCLC) has developed a cost-effective
		on-line shared cataloging system, now in widespread use by U.S. libraries.. It 
		could readily serve as a pattern for a system to create and share descriptive 
		indexing on-line.. A proposed system is outlined, possible developers are noted,
		and further action is urged..
