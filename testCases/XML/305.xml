		   Inflation is currently affected library book budgets, particularly with 
		respect to the acquisition of serials.. A model is proposed which would balance
		the purchase of serials against the purchase of monographs by individual 
		funding units within the academic library.. Special consideration is given to 
		inflation as a cost factor affected by both the form of publication and the 
		subject matter.. Applying the model to a specific example demonstrates its use 
		in providing control over collection development and allowing for equitable 
		distribution of book funds among funding units..
