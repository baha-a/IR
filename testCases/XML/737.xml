	<title>The Large Data Base File Structure Dilemma	</title>
	<author>Lefkovitz, D.	</author>
	<text>
		  This paper first presents a brief tutorial on the principal random file
		organization methods for handling two major applications - Transaction
		oriented systems and Information storage and retrieval systems.  It then
		addresses a particular large data base dilemma, not satisfactorily
		resolved by any of these methods, and which is currently under active
		investigation.  Two approaches to a solution are described.  One is
		called the hybrid inverted list; the other is based upon an old technique
		called super-imposed coding.  The former has been implemented and has 
		recently been installed in an operational system.  Some statistics related
		to file characteristics in this application are provided, but operational
		cost and performance statistics are not yet available.
