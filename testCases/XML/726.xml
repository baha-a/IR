	<author>Hansen, Inge Berg	</author>
	<text>
		   The performance of CA Condensates and Chemical Titles based on analysis of
		precision and "relative recall CT/CC" for a collection of 46 search profiles 
		was studied over a period of one year.. Special emphasis was laid on the 
		function of the keyword phrases of CC and the users' attitude towards 
		literature categories not represented in CT.. The results are discussed in 
		terms of the value of the systems for Danish users seen from users' and the 
		documentalist's point of view..
