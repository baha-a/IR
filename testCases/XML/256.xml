	<title>The Civic Culture	</title>

		  We are concerned in this book with a number of classic themes
		of political science: with what the Greeks called civic virtue and its
		consequences for the effectiveness and stability of the democratic
		polity; and with the kind of community life, social organization, and
		upbringing of children that fosters civic virtue.  In using survey
		research to study these classic themes, we are also following the
		traditional practice of relying on the most precise methods available to
		us for the investigation of these problems.  Perhaps Tocqueville and
		Bryce, were they living today, would have relied somewhat on
		the cross-section survey in their comparative studies of democratic
		attitudes.
