		   The advent of machine-readable data bases is one of the most significant 
		forward steps in information retrieval.. Currently, the creation and 
		application of these data bases are in a period of very rapid growth.. This
		reviewer sees a great need for a review of "what is going on" because there is 
		so much going on.. It is the goal of this chapter to fulfill that need even 
		though it is difficult to hold this dynamic field static for a good meaningful 
		look..
