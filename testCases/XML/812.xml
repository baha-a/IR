	<title>A Statistical Interpretation of Term Specificity and Its Application in Retrieval	</title>
	<author>Sparck-Jones, K.	</author>
	<text>
		   The exhaustivity of document descriptions and the specificity of index terms
		are usually regarded as independent.. It is suggested that specificity should be
		interpreted statistically, as a function of term use rather than of term 
		meaning.. The effect on retrieval of variations in term specificity are 
		examined, experiments with three test collections showing in particular that
		frequently-occurring terms are required for good overall performance.. It is
		argued that terms should be weighted according to collection frequency, so that 
		matches on less frequent, more specific, terms are of greater value than matches
		on frequent terms.. Results for the test collections show that considerable 
		improvements in performance are obtained with this very simple procedure..
