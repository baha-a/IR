		  A battle is currently being waged at the University of Maryland School
		of Library and Information Services; its outcome will influence the future
		of the library profession.  Because of the significance of this controversy,
		this situation at Maryland is here brought to the attention of the
		profession at large.   Last fall, a group, with funding
		from the Office of Education, brought into being an educational
		program which is addressing the profession's most critical problems,
		those central to its survival as a viable social institution:  The library
		profession's need to define and fulfill an important service function in the
		public arena; its failure to make itself relevant to other than middle-class
		interests in the culture; and its inavailability to contribute to the
		alleviation of the severe social, economic, and other inequalities which exist 
		in the culture and which continue to deprive black Americans particularly of 
		even minimal life opportunities.
