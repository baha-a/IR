		   The use of an on-line information retrieval system by the scientists 
		themselves is described.. MEDUSA was designed to allow physicians to 
		interrogate the MEDLARS data base.. A brief description is given of the system 
		and details of an experiment to test its effectiveness.. Search formulation 
		prepared on-line by medical research workers are compared for recall and 
		precision with the same requests formulated by search editors in the normal 
		way.. The results show that physicians can use an on-line system effectively..
