		    Although the use of games in professional education has
		become widespread only during the last decade, the method has
		been used in a number of fields for many hundreds of years.
		Its origins have been traced to simple war games, used in
		military training when the "real thing" was either unavailable
		or too dangerous.  In more recent times, these games have
		become more and more sophisticated, and many now use large
		electronic computers to handle the complex calculations involved.
		Since 1956, when the first well-developed management game was
		introduced, the technique has spread rapidly into a
		wide variety of disciplines and today it is used at all levels
		of education, from primary school classes to courses for experienced
		men and women.  One of the main causes of this "game explosion" has been
		the rapid development of sophisticated management techniques, such
		as simulation and mathematical modelling, which have been made possible
		by rapid advances in computer technology.
