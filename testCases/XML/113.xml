	<title>Measuring the Quality of Sociological Research:Problems in the Use of the Science Citation Index	</title>

		The Problem of assessing the "quality" of scientific
		publications has long been a major impediment to
		progress in the sociology of science.  Most researchers
		have typically paid homage to the belief that quantity of
		output is not the equivalent of quality and have then gone
		ahead and used publication counts anyway (Coler, 1963;
		Crane, 1965; Price, 1963; Wilson, 1964).  There seemed
		to be no practicable way to measure the quality of large
		numbers of papers or the life's work of large numbers of
		scientists.  The invention of the Science Citation Index
		(SCI) a few years ago provides a new and reliable tool
		to measure the significance of individual scientists'
		contributions.  Starting in 1961, the SCI has listed all
		bibliographic references appearing in an increasingly large
		number of journals.  The number of citations an
		individual receives may be tabulated and used as an indicator
		of the relative scientific significance or "quality" of that
		individual's publications.
