		  This study undertakes to document the process and the thinking
		that led Leyh to his controversial professional-political activities
		and his widely criticized writings in his later years.  Every effort
		has been made to present the documentary material and to analyze
		Leyh's reactions to political and psychological pressures without
		favoring any particular position.  Neither a justification nor a
		critique of Leyh's actions is intended.
