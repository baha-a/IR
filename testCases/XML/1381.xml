		compilation.
		Chapter I considers general questions related to the compilation and use of
		frequency vocabulary; a new Zipf's Law.
		Chapter III considers various ways of describing the statistical properties
		of a text and its lexicon, and presents the results of the author's research
		on the statistic structure of Pushkin's lexicon.
		Chapter IV considers methods for comparing the vocabulary of texts.
		A new method for comparing word lists is suggested, which is then used for
		comparing word lists from the different geures in Pushkin's works.
