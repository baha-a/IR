		  The test results are presented for a number of different index languages
		using various devices which affect recall or precision.  Within the environment
		of this test, it is shown that the best performance was obtained with
		the group of eight index languages which used single terms.  The group of
		fifteen index languages which were based on concepts gave the worst performance,
		while a group of six index languages based on the Thesaurus of
		Engineering Terms of the Engineers Joint Council were intermediary.  Of
		the single term index languages, the only method of improving performance
		was to group synonyms and word forms, and any broader groupings of terms
		depressed performance.  The use of precision devices such as links gave no
		advantage as compared to the basic device of simple coordination.
