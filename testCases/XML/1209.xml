	<title>Is Journal Publication Obsolescent?	</title>

		  Orderly communication through research journals may be jeopardized by a
		developing national information system that is beginning to encroach on the
		domain of the primary publication system.  The author also believes mass
		distribution of unedited, unreferred and often unproofed preprints, which
		has recently been proposed, would put journals out of business or transform
		them into depositories.
