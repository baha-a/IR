	<title>Paper Impermanence as a Consequence of pH and Storage Conditions	</title>
	<author>Smith, R.D.	</author>
	<text>
		  This article aims to provide some basic information, references to further
		information, and a sense of proportion about the action of hydrogen ions and
		storage conditions on paper.  Other  important causes of paper deterioration,
		such as oxidative degradation, biological attack, photocatalyzed degradation,
		and mechanical wear and tear, will not be considered at this time.
