	<text>
		   In an effort to develop a simple method for librarians to employ to measure
		and evaluate author catalogue use, the Library Management Research Unit tested
		a survey design in four varying libraries.. The reader was asked to note details
		of items not found in the catalogue, the source of the reference, and his 
		status.. The items were then checked by library staff to discover the cause of
		"failure".. Library staff interviewed samples of catalogue users to determine 
		the overall rate of "failure", the cooperation (with "Catalogue Query Slips") 
		rate, and the action readers proposed to take in order to obtain the item(s) not
		found in the catalogue..
