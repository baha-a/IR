	<title>Articulation in the Generation of Subject Indexes by computer	</title>
	<author>Armitage, J.E.	</author>
	<text>
		  A simple and logical model for the automatic generation of subject indexes
		from title like phrases is described, and its advantages and disadvantages
		are discussed.	It is based on recent studies of the structure of articulated
		subject indexes, such as those to Chemical Abstracts.  The model employs the
		prepositions and connectives of phrases of simple structure as articulating
		points, and selects from all possible forms of entries those which lead to
		optimal organization in an index.  The technique is illustrated with part of an
		index to a recent abstracting journal.  The wide variety of
		controls which can be exerted by the indexer and the program is discussed.
