		  A data base of 1873 citations dated 1960-1969 was obtained through an 
		author survey of the members of the Society of Toxicology.  Coverage was
		determined by checking the author index through a maximum of three years
		after publication or through the end of the decade.  Chemical Abstracts
		consistently provided coverage of more than two-thirds of the 1960-1967
		citations in the data base.  Chemical Abstracts, Biological Abstracts,
		Index Medicus, and Science Citation Index each provided coverage of 79%
		to 85% of the 215 citations dated 1966 and their combined coverage exceeded
		98%.  Excerpta Medica (Section IIC) and Chemical-Biological Activities
		provided 43% and 58% coverage, respectively, of this same group of 215
		citations.
