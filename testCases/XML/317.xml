	<title>Natural Language Question - Answering System: 1969	</title>
	<author>Simmons, Robert F.	</author>
	<text>
		   Recent experiments in programming natural language question-answering system
		are reviewed to summarize the methods that have been developed for syntactic, 
		semantic, and logical analysis of English strings.. It is concluded that at
		least minimally effective  techniques have been devised for answering questions
		from natural language subsets in small scale experimental systems and that a 
		useful paradigm has evolved to guide research efforts in the field.. Current 
		approaches to semantic analysis and logical inference are seen to be effective 
		beginnings but of questionable generality with respect either to subtle aspects
		of meaning or to applications over large subset of English.. Generalizing from
		current small-scale experiments to language processing systems based on 
		dictionaries with thousands of entries - with correspondingly large grammars 
		and semantic systems - may entail a new order of complexity and require the 
		invention and development of entirely different approaches to semantic analysis 
		and question answering..
