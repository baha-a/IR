	<title>Problems in Organizing Library Collections	</title>
	<author>Hickey, D.J.	</author>
	<text>
		    In the area of library work often called "cataloging" and, more broadly,
		"technical services," the student may fall into two errors: that of assuming
		that all work is strictly routine and mechanical, and that of viewing the tasks
		of organizing a library collection as self-contained.  One purpose of the case
		studies here presented is to help correct both these errors, and to do so
		by illuminating some of the ways in which interpersonal relations affect the
		character of the routines and by setting the organizational tasks in the broader
		context of the total library situation.
