	<text>
		  This book aims primarily to provide guidelines for library administrators
		and library systems analysts in analyzing and evaluating existing operating
		systems and in designing new or improved ones.  In addition, we have
		found the material to be very useful in staff training programs conducted
		to ensure knowledgeable staff participation and cooperation in a systems
		study.  This guide is also adaptable for introducing library school students
		to the concepts of systems study in the library.
