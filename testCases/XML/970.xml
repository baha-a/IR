		  The Information Systems Office (ISO) of the Library of Congress has as its 
		mission the development and implementation of the main automation
		program for the Library and the co-ordination of all LC automation efforts.  
		One of the primary activities in this effort is a system-development
		study concentrating on the central bibliographic operations, that is, 
		acquisitions, cataloging, reference, etc.  This study is now in its early
		stages, and it is too soon to predict the actual system that will evolve.  
		As an adjunct to this study an analysis of the potential uses of and
		problems involved in the machine processing of cataloging data was begun.  One 
		aspect of the analysis was the design of a preliminary machine-
		readable catalog record.  The results of this work are in a report issued by 
		the ISO as its "Planning Memorandum Number 3."
