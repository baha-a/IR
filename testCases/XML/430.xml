	<title>On Fuzzy Mapping and Control	</title>
	<author>Chang, Sheldon S.L.Zaden, Lofti A.	</author>
	<text>
		   A fuzzy mapping from X to Y is a fuzzy set on X * Y.. The concept is 
		extended to fuzzy mappings of fuzzy set on X to Y, fuzzy function and its 
		inverse, fuzzy parametric function, fuzzy observation, and control.. Set
		theoretical relations are obtained for fuzzy mappings, fuzzy functions, and 
		fuzzy parametric functions.. It is shown that under certain conditions a 
		precise control goal can be attained with fuzzy observation and control as long 
		as the observations become sufficiently precise when the goal is approached..
