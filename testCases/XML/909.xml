	<title>Libraries and Librarianship in the West: A Brief History	</title>
	<author>Jackson, S.L.	</author>
	<text>
		  This book was written in an attempt to fill a gap.  If one ignored the major
		historical resources in other languages (which few United States students read),
		notably the Handbuch der Bibliothekswissenschaft, edited by Fritz Milkau and
		others (2d ed., Leipzig: Harrassowitz, 1952-1957; Registerband, 1965), it was
		plain that the goodly company of works available did not meet all fundamental
		needs.  The most nearly comprehensive treatment was Elmer C. Johnson's A
		History of Libraries in the Western World (Scarecrow, 1965), which remains in
		its second edition (Scarecrow, 1970) solid and attractive reading but continues
		as announced to cover only libraries.  Its attention to librarianship is very
		limited; numerous important theorists are not even mentioned.  Furthermore,
		the predominant organization by type of library hampers the analysis of
		crosscurrents between libraries and life and thought, particularly the
		development of the image of the library and librarian.  The aim here has been
		to tie it all together.
		  In the present offering, "the West" is used conventionally: European 
		civilization, with its Near Eastern ancestors and its Western Hemisphere
		progeny.  The limitation is practical.  To try to "cover" even the West may
		prove to be too much for one person; to go beyond would be rash.  Yet an
		understanding of those lands "beyond" would be most valuable to us all.
		Let us hope that someone will try to provide it.
