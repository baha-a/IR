		  As part of a design study to specify a regional processing
		center for the New England state university libraries, it was
		required to know the percentage of collection overlap with respect to
		each of the 30 ordered pairs of 6 libraries.  Participating states were
		Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and
		Connecticut.  This overlap data was needed to predict the degree of
		joint use of cataloging information and to estimate the efficiency of
		collective reclassification.
		  The results revealed a high degree of commonality in the 6 collections,
		showing, for example, that a random title from one library had 
		a 40% chance of being present in another randomly selected library.
		When current imprint samples were tested, the figure rose to 47%.
		Rhode Island's holdings were shown to be the collection of greatest
		duplication elsewhere.
