		   Description of a technique for compressing data to be placed in computer
		auxiliary storage.. The technique operates on the principle of taking two
		alphabetic characters frequently used in combination and replacing them with
		one unused special character code.. Such one-for-two replacement has enabled
		the ILO to achieve a rate of compression of 43.5% on a data base of 
		approximately 40,000 bibliographic records..
