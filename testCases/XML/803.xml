		  The term 'informatics' was first advanced formally by the Director
		of Viniti, A.I. Mikhailov, and his colleagues A.I. Chernyi and R.S.
		Gilyarevskii, in their paper Informatics - new name for the theory of Scientific
		Information published at the end of 1966.  An English translation was
		circularized in the beginning of 1967.  As the authors state in this paper,
		they are not the first to use this term, and they quote a review by Professor
		J.G. Dorfmann of their own book Fundamentals of Scientific Information in
		which Dorfmann criticizes the use of other terminology, such as 'documentation',
		'documentalistics', 'information science', and so on.
		  Their definition is as stated above but they are careful to add the rider that 
		Informatics does not investigate the specific content of scientific information,
		only the structure and properties.  In their paper they also advance definitions
		for 'information', 'scientific information', 'scientific information activity',
		'information officer', and 'information scientist'.  They have backed up their
		proposal by changing the title of their own book for its second edition, and
		the title of the information science fascicule of the Referativnyi Zhurnal,
		which is now called Informatiki.
