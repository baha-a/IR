		  This report attempts to present and interpret current
		(Winter 1968-69) information on the economics of book storage
		in relation to the other factors a university administrator
		must consider in developing a program for housing an
		ever-growing book collection when there are present or
		future limitations on space and money.
		  The study will attempt to answer two specific questions:
		1) Is it economical for colleges and universities to select
		so-called little-used books from the regular bookstacks and
		store them elsewhere? 2) Is the cost factor the only one a
		university need consider in adopting a storage program; and,
		if not, how is cost related to the others?
		  The facts and conclusions in this report are based on
		the library book storage situation as of 1969.  Innovations
		in computer applications and other technologies could
		presumably change the nature of some of the cost factors, but
		it is the author's opinion that these changes unlikely to
		occur within the next 5 to 10 years.
