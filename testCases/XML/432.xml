	<text>
		  Illustrative Computer Programming is intended as
		a graded workbook or text supplement containing
		typical practical problems, suggested solutions, and
		tried analyses which emphasize programming efficiency
		and some of the major features of PL/I (Programming
		Language/One).  As such, it can be used alone or in
		combination with established PL/I textbooks such as
		those listed in the Selected Bibliography.  Programmers
		with knowledge of other languages will not be bothered
		by excessive introductory material, while beginners can
		learn much by looking at the solutions to the problems
		and their accompanying analyses.
