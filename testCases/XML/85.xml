	<title>Information Science: Toward the Development of a True Scientific Discipline	</title>

		   It is pointed out that if information science is to be considered a "true" 
		science similar to physics or chemistry then it must have a set of concepts and
		analytical expression which apply to the flow of information in a general way..
		In several previous papers, the author and a colleague have described a model 
		of a generalized information system which has  wide, and perhaps universal 
		applicability.. This paper elaborates on this model and indicates the range of 
		its applicability.. Several fundamental quantities are defined specifically in 
		a way which allows for quantification.. It is pointed out in this paper that 
		this model can be the basis for the development of a "true" science of 
		information with all of the necessary requirements for a science.. By the use 
		of this model and the definition of a "true" science, the goals and requirements 
		for a curriculum in information science are thus established.. Within this 
		context, information is defined as data of value in decision making.. 
		Quantitative measures of information can be obtained by relating information to 
		specific observable actions which can be measured physically..
