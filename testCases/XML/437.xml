		  This book is written in the belief that the full and speedy application
		of science in industry is necessary to economic progress, and
		should indeed be one of the most important objectives of national
		policy.  This being so, it is important to identify the hindrances to
		speedy application.  Many people have already drawn attention to
		particular hindrances but the three bodies which have sponsored this report
		did not consider that there was any up-to-date assessment of the problem
		which attempted to look at it as a whole, in all its variety and complexity.
		Hence the investigation which they undertook, and largely entrusted to us;
		an investigation which, through the great goodwill of many people in British
		industry, has yielded so much material that this book can only be a first
		impression and summary.
