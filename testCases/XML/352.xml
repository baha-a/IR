		  This book presents the concept of the modern library as a comprehensive
		resource center.  The philosophy and objectives of the center are clarified,
		and desirable practices in the selection and acquisition of nonbook or
		audiovisual materials - interchangeably defined as those materials that 
		communicate primarily through aural and visual stimuli - are recommended,
		along with information pertinent to facilitating these tasks.  Their 
		organization in general in discussed, with emphasis on the necessity for
		basic decisions and policies.  Cataloging and physical processing are treated
		in particular, demonstrating that accepted library practices can be flexible
		enough to allow adaptation for both the individual library and its specific
		clientele.  Realistic methods of handling the many different kinds of nonbook
		materials are demonstrated by treating each type separately.  Many easy-to-
		follow cataloging examples are presented; and, consistent with established
		library routine, practical information is provided on selection, acquisition,
		physical processing, storage, and equipment.  Work-flow charts are included
		to present a graphic demonstration of efficient procedures.
