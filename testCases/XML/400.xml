		  Communication technology has entered a period of revolutionary change.
		  The last decade has brought new inventions of enormous potential.
		It will probably be two decades before we fully grasp the shattering effect
		they will have on society.
		  These inventions include:
		  The communication satellite.  Suddenly this has provided telephone
		and television links to the underdeveloped world.  Much larger satellites
		will be built and will have an enormous impact on education and
		communications both in the United States and throughout the world.  The
		satellite antennae in some underdeveloped countries stand next to fields
		ploughed by oxen.
		  The helical waveguide.  A pipe, now operating, that can carry 250,000
		simultaneous telephone calls or equivalent information over long distances.
		  The laser.  This means of transmission, still in the research laboratory,
		has the potential of carrying many millions of simultaneous telephone calls
		or their equivalent.
		  Large-scale integration (LSI).  A form of ultraminiaturized computer
		circuitry that probably marks the beginning of mass production of
		computers and computerlike logic circuitry.  It offers the potential of
		extremely reliable, extremely small, and, in some of its forms, extremely
		fast computers.  If large-enough quantities can be built, this circuitry can
		become very low in cost.
		  On-line real-time computers.  Computers capable of responding to many
		distant terminals on telecommunication lines at a speed geared to human
		thinking.  They have the potential of bringing the power and information
		of innumerable computers into every office and eventually every home.
		  Picturephone.  A public dial-up telephone system in which subscribers
		see as well as hear each other.
		  Large TV screens.  TV screens that can occupy a whole wall if necessary.
		  Cable TV.  Provides a cable into homes with a potential signal-carrying
		capacity more than one thousand times that of the telephone cable.  It
		could be used for signals other than television.
		  Voice answerback.  Computers can now assembly human-voice words and
		speak them over the telephone.  This fact, coupled with the Touchtone
		telephone set, makes every such telephone a potential computer terminal.
		  Millimeter-wave radio.  Radio at frequencies in the band above the
		microwave band can relay a quantity of information greater than all the
		other radio bands combined.  Chains of closely spaced antennas will distribute
		these millimeter-wave signals.
		  Pulse code modulation.  All signals, including telephone, Picturephone,
		music, facsimile, and television can be converted into digital bit stream
		and transmitted, along with computer data, over the same digital links.
		Major advantages accrue from this.
		  Computerized switching.  Computerized telephone exchanges are coming into
		operation, and computer-like logic can be employed for switching and
		"concentrating" all types of signals.
		  Data banks.  Electronic storage for huge quantities of information that
		can be manipulated and indexed by computers and that can be accessed in a
		fraction of a second.
