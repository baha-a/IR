	<title>Structural Models:  an introduction to the theory of directed graphs	</title>
	<author>Harary, F.	</author>
	<text>
		  The purpose of this book is to present an introduction to a body of
		mathematics concerned with the abstract notion of "structure."  Its
		preparation has been motivated by the belief that knowledge of the
		mathematics of abstract structures will be of value to investigators
		interested in various kinds of empirical structures.  The mathematics
		with which we are concerned is known as the theory of directed graphs,
		or more briefly as digraph theory.  It deals with abstract configurations
		called digraphs, which consist of "points" and "directed lines."  When
		these terms are given concrete referents, digraphs serve as mathematical
		models of empirical structures, and properties of digraphs reflect
		structural properties of the empirical world.  Since the same mathematical
		terms can be given a variety of empirical meanings, digraph theory has
		applicability to many different fields of investigation.
