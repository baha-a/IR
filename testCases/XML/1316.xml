	<text>
		  This is an essay in the sociology of scientific knowledge written with
		the sociology of knowledge and culture, generally, very much in
		mind.  As a sociological study it is unusual in that the form and
		content of scientific knowledge is the main concern and not its
		organization or distribution.
