	<text>
		   A comprehensive automated bibliographic control system has been developed by
		the New York Public Library.. This system is unique in its use of an automated 
		authority system and highly sophisticated machine  filing algorithms.. The 
		primary aim was the rigorous control of established forms and their 
		cross-reference structure.. The original impetus for creation of the system,
		and its most highly visible product, is a photocomposed book catalog.. The 
		book catalog subsystem supplies automatic punctuation of condensed entries and
		contains the ability to produce cumulation/supplement book catalogs in 
		installments without loss of control of the cross referencing structure..
