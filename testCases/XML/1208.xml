		  In 1966, AIP had a modest program in physics information supported by the
		National Science Foundation.  The program went back several years, and
		AIP was considering a major expansion. The first task faced in such an
		expansion was to augment the staff so as to be interdisciplinary in physics,
		computer operations and scientific information.  The staff would be able
		to analyze and extend the studies made at AIP and elsewhere, and would 
		formulate a basic approach.
