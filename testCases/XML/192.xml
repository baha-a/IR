		serial title in a region is outlined.. The system assures the equitable
		distribution of the number of titles for which each library is committed..
		Later refinements suggest an equalization of cost commitments on the basis of
		fiscal resources available for serial purchases.. It is pointed out that fiscal
		realities will force some sort of serial acquisition cooperation for all viable
		medical libraries..
