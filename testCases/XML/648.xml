		   The early 1970's have clearly shown a trend toward the use of on-line systems
		as the ideal medium for information retrieval.. The emphasis placed on direct 
		access by the practitioners in the field, rather than delegated searches through
		information specialists, leads to the growing need for an efficient design in 
		training transient user groups.. Printed manuals, live help, audiovisual 
		presentations and on-line instructions have all been used with varying degrees of
		success.. The author contends that the use of computer-assisted instruction in 
		conjunction with the on-line information retrieval system is the most promising
		form of instruction in that the medium itself, as well as the message may be 
		used to acquaint the novice searcher with an interactive user/system 
		interface..
