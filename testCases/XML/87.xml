		The following books and journals
		for the Core Nursing Library,
		suggested reference materials,
		and supplementary books and journals
		were selected by experts in nursing
		from all parts of the United States.
		The purpose is to let practitioners
		and community hospitals
		know which books and journals,
		from a wealth of printed material
		would, in the opinion of experts, be
		most useful, especially where funds
		and space are limited.
