		  A computer-operated storage and retrieval system for chemical structures
		based on the use of the IUPAC notation has been in operation at Shell
		Research Limited, Sittingbourne, Kent, England, since 1965, involving a
		file of nearly 50,000 compounds.  Use of the IUPAC cipher has proved 
		advantageous as regards speed and cost of both input and searching.  For
		most searches, scanning of the information explicit in the cipher has proved
		adequate.  Our computer programs also enable conversion of ciphers into atom-
		connection tables and generation of fragmentation codes.  The integrated use
		of these facilities and their merits relative to other approaches are discussed.
