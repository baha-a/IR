	<title>Selection of Equifrequent Word Fragments for Information Retrieval	</title>

		   The design of programs to research large document data bases is discussed 
		with regard to the use of compression coding combined with adoption of word 
		fragments as the basic language elements.. An algorithm is described for 
		determination of a set of almost equifrequent fragments.. Its efficiency is 
		tested for a sample data base formed from the MARC tapes.. A certain threshold 
		frequency acts as a parameter whose value determines the number of distinct 
		fragments.. The selection algorithm is designed to give some preference to 
		choice of the longest fragments and hence allow compact coding of the data base 
		by concatenation of non-overlapping fragments..
