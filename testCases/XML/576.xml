		   A study was undertaken to classify mechanically a document collection using 
		the free-language words in the titles and abstracts of a corpus of 261 physics
		research papers.. Using a clustering algorithm, results were obtained which
		closely duplicated the clusters obtained by previous experiments with 
		citations.. A brief comparison is made with a traditional manual classification
		system.. It is shown that the mechanical procedure is capable of achieving 
		simultaneous average relevance and recall figures above 80%..
