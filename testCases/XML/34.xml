	<title>Keyword-In-Context Index for Technical Literature (KWIC Index)	</title>

	<text>
		   A distinction is made between bibliographical indexes for new and past
		literature based on the willingness of the user to trade perfection for 
		currency.. Indexes giving keywords in their context are proposed as suitable 
		for disseminating new information.. These can be entirely machine-generated 
		and hence kept up-to-date with the current literature.. A compatible coding 
		scheme to identify the indexed documents is also proposed.. In it elements are
		automatically extracted from the usual identifiers of the document so that the 
		coded identifier yields a maximum of information while remaining susceptible 
		to normal methods of ordering..
