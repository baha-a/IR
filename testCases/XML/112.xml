		  In sociology today, as in other sciences, the professional
		journals serve as major channels for the dissemination of
		ideas and information.  The papers presented in the
		principal periodicals reach a wide audience among sociologists,
		are acknowledged as the best work, and stand as
		models for all who aspire to success.  The viewpoints, conceptual 
		schemes, interests, and methodologies reflected in
		these articles are therefore significant influences on both
		the current character and the future development of our
		discipline.
