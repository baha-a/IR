	<title>Automatic Classification and Retrieval of Documents by Means   of a Bibliographic Pattern Discovery Algorithm	</title>

	<text>
		   We present completely automatic procedures for the self-generation of 
		meaningful groups among the members of a document collection and for the 
		classification according to these groups of subsequent documents.. These
		procedures operate on large document collections with reasonably short
		computation times.. Thus far, in our experiments on the physics literature,
		automatic classification has proven to be as good as or better than manual
		indexing and, in addition, potentially less expensive.. Empirically derived, 
		our method is based upon a pattern discovery algorithm which use only the 
		citation content of a document and with operates on the bibliographic links 
		among papers.. The self-generated groups correspond to very specific subject 
		headings; retrospective bibliographies generated in the procedures allow one 
		to classify the subsequent literature with remarkably high recall and 
		relevance ratios, close to 100%..
