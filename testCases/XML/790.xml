	<text>
		   An automatic indexing method is described in which index tags for documents 
		are generated by the computer.. The computer scans the text of periodical 
		articles and automatically assigns to them index terms with their respective 
		weights on the basis of explicitly defined text characteristics.. A machine 
		file of document references with their associated index terms is automatically 
		produced which can be searched on a co-ordinate basis for the retrieval of 
		specified drug-related information..
