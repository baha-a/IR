		  This report presents the results of a detailed analysis by
		the National Library of Medicine of the performance of
		MEDLARS (its Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval
		System) in relation to 300 actual requests made to the
		system in 1966 and 1967.  Thanks to this study, we now know
		considerably more about the requirements of MEDLARS users,
		how well the system is meeting these requirements, and what
		we must do to improve the overall performance level.  The
		investigation is timely:  the Library is now planning a
		second-generation MEDLARS, and the design of MEDLARS II
		should benefit greatly from our knowledge of factors affecting
		the performance of the present system.
