		  We have tried in this paper to describe some of the main features of the
		emergence and growth of radio astronomy, with special reference to the crucial
		developments occurring in the UK.  Much of what we have written above needs
		to be discussed in the light of current theories about the nature of
		scientific growth and compared with data from other case studies.
