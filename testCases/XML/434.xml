	<author>Soergel, D.	</author>
	<text>
		  This book has two objectives.  First, to reassess thoroughly the functions
		of an indexing language or thesaurus in a information storage and retrieval
		system and in the light of this reassessment to analyze the structure of 
		indexing languages and thesauri.  Most importantly, this reassessment is based
		on a unified view of indexing languages (classification schemes) and thesauri 
		as information storage and retrieval systems on the other.  It results in 
		general principles that are applicable to a wide range of situations.
