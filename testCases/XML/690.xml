		  New computer methods have been developed in associations with the drug
		development programs of the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research.  Experiences
		with these systems are recounted.  Special input devices and computer 
		programming have been developed for the input and retrieval of conventional
		chemical structural diagrams.  The costs, operation, and the advantages of this
		system are discussed.  Associated files of biological properties and inventory
		control information have been created, which are searchable.  The methods used
		in creating consolidated listings of selected chemical compounds and associated
		biological data are discussed.
