	<title>The Cranfield II Relevance Assessments: A Critical Evaluation	</title>
	<author>Harter, Stephen P.	</author>
	<text>
		   The relevance assessments belonging to the Cranfield II document/query
		collection are shown to be faulty, in the sense that "many" relevant documents
		were not so identified by the Cranfield judges.. The implications of these
		omissions for the evaluation of information retrieval experiments based on the
		Cranfield collection are examined in detail..It is shown that numerical measures
		of retrieval effectiveness may be greatly altered bu consideration of the 
		"missing" relevant documents and that a ranking  of retrieval methods according 
		to order of performance may vary as well..
