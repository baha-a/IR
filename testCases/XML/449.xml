	<text>
		   The concept of situational relevance is introduced, based on W.S.Cooper's
		definitions of logical relevance, on the notion of evidential relevance drawn
		from inductive logic, on the notions of a personal stock of knowledge and a set 
		of personal concerns, the latter explained in terms of preferences over ranges 
		of alternatives.. Situationally relevant items of information are those that 
		answer, or logically help to answer, questions of concern.. Significant 
		situationally relevant information is explained in terms of changes of view in 
		relation to questions of concern.. It is claimed that situational relevance is 
		an explication of the ordinary notion of practical relevance, and that it is 
		the appropriate relevance concept to use in evaluation of systems supplying 
		practically relevant information..
