		  Of all the problems which have, of recent years,
		engaged the attention of educators and librarians
		none have been more puzzling than those posed by
		the astonishing growth of our great research 
		libraries.  My own interest in this subject has, 
		over several years, resulted in a series of papers,
		some of them mainly analyzes, but others of them
		endeavoring to suggest answers to what has 
		sometimes seemed to be an almost insoluble puzzle.
