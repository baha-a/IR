	<title>The Derivation and Application of the Bradford-Zipf Distribution	</title>
	<author>Brookes, B. C.	</author>

		   Any statistical regularities found in documentation should be fully 
		exploited to produce estimates or predictions and to save documentalists work..
		But present formulations of the Bradford distribution demand penetrating search
		for peripheral papers and tedious computation in application.. The present 
		paper shows that the Bradford distribution is closely related to the Zipf
		distribution.. It requires data on only the most productive journals, is
		mathematically simple and amenable to graphical methods if a proposed idea of
		the 'completeness' of a search is accepted.. For comparability of results, 
		certain conditions, which include a specified minimum level of productivity of 
		journals, need to be standardized.. A standard form is suggested..
		   It is found, however, that a modified form of the Bradford distribution is 
		required when Bradford-type collections of journals are merged into large
		collections, when 'saturation' of the most productive journals occurs..
