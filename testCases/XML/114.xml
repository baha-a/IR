	<title>The Analysis of Information Systems	</title>
	<author>Meadow, C.T.	</author>
	<text>
		  This book is intended to supply the background needed for
		participation in the analysis and design of information-handling
		systems and for understanding the literature in the field.
		I have tried to present a unified approach to the subject
		and to the relation of information retrieval to other
		disciplines and an appreciation of the importance of this
		interdisciplinary relationship.  I hope that the scientist
		or computer programmer, newly interested in information-retrieval
		problems, as well as the librarian, will find the book of value.
