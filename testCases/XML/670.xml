		  As early as 1961, we in the engineering Department of
		Du Pont recognized the need for a better system for
		recording chemical structure information for storage and
		subsequent retrieval.  We believed that current methods
		and the then current development of notation systems
		would not completely serve our chemists' long range
		chemical identification needs.
		  Accordingly, we studied and then developed a chemical
		structure storage and search system.  Huber gave a good
		review of the various approaches and applications.  To use
		his terminology, our system is topological coding.
		  Our initial investigation led to singling out the following
		needs for such a system.
