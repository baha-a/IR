		            Theory and practice regarding patterns of decision-
		making in libraries have been relatively neglected aspects of
		library administration.  Yet the decisions by which a library
		attempts to control its operations are of major importance to its
		welfare and effectiveness.  Recent theories in management and social
		psychology have addressed themselves to the implications of 
		participative management and group decision-making, and their findings 
		appear to have important applications to libraries, not the least of
		which is personnel development.
