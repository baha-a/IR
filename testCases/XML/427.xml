	<title>The Validity of Subjective Probability of Success Forecastsby R and D Project Managers	</title>

		    Models and techniques to aid management in planning
		controlling RandD projects frequently use subjective probability of
		success forecasts as one of the major inputs.  An experiment was
		conducted at the research laboratories of Monsanto Company to
		measure the predictive validity and consistency of such forecasts.
		The results indicate that the eventual success or failure of certain
		types of RandD projects can be predicted by measuring the time shape
		of polled probability of success forecasts.  Probability of success
		forecasts appear to yield more valid advance warning indicators than
		several commonly used project status measures.  These results tend
		to support the hypothesis that RandD planning and control models that
		are based on subjective probability estimates may reliably be used
		by management to aid in early identification of eventually failing
		projects, as well as to aid in project selection and project funding.
