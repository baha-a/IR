		  Late in 1964, The Chemical Abstracts Service announced
		that in 1965 it would lease Chemical Abstracts in microfilm
		form to subscribers to its current printed abstracts.  With
		this move, microfilm entered a new stage - use in technical-
		information work as a publication medium for frequently
		employed tools rather than for largely archival documents.
