		  The introduction of Chemical titles in 1961 marked the
		first publication produced almost entirely by computers
		and other data-processing equipment.  The success of this
		innovation has generated many requests for more information
		about it.  With this in mind, we hope to encourage
		other organizations to make use of this technique for
		dissemination of information by presenting here a history
		of Chemical titles' development coupled with a description
		of its production.
