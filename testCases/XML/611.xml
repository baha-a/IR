	<title>What Information Dissemination Studies Imply Concerning the Design ofOn-Line Reference Retrieval Systems*	</title>
	<author>Back, Harry B.	</author>
	<text>
		   The use of an on-line computer system for locating bibliographic citations
		has been hailed as an important innovation for coping with the "information
		explosion.." However, on-line reference retrieval is only one element in a
		large social system of information dissemination.. To have a widespread impact,
		an on-line system must compete successfully with a multitude of other sources
		of references.. This paper reviews studies of information dissemination as a
		basis for determining how on-line retrieval can best compete.  It recommends
		the functional groups for whom an on-line system should be designed and the
		forms of written media that should be included in the system's initial data
		base.. Finally, it presents criteria the system should satisfy to be as widely
		used and as comprehensive as other reference retrieval methods..
