		  This book describes some of the various ways in which a computer
		could be used as part of a library system.  In doing so, it aims to bridge
		the gap between librarian and computer specialist, by introducing
		computers to those involved in library work, especially students of
		librarianship, and at the same time helping to make those interested
		in the computer applications field aware of the potential and problems
		of the library environment.
