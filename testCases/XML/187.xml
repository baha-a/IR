		   An investigation of the manpower requirements of health sciences libraries
		and of educational programs appropriate to these manpower needs was begun in 
		March 1968.. To data, 4,727 libraries have been identified as being used by
		14,000 health sciences institutions and programs.. Of this total, 2,628 are 
		hospital libraries; 1,328 are health sciences libraries; and 771 are academic 
		or public libraries..
		   Within these libraries some 14,938 persons are directly involved, either
		full- or part-time, in the delivery of health sciences library services.. Of
		the total work force, 5,861 persons are employed in hospital libraries and
		9,077 are employed in health sciences libraries and collections.. The ratio
		between professional and nonprofessional employees is 1:2; professional and
		nonprofessional status was assigned by the chief librarian.. Survey data
		indicate a 7 percent manpower shortage in positions classified as professional,
		and a 3 percent shortage in positions classified as nonprofessional..
