	<text>
		   The paper makes a discussion of major theoretical and experimental studies
		of the role of informal processes of communication in science..  The author
		holds that the system of scientific communications is based on formal processes
		(founded on scientific and technical literature, including the primary and
		secondary sources), whereas the informal processes (in which scientists play
		the leading part and which have no institutionalized and permanent interactive
		mechanisms) are also very important, but auxiliary..  The specific features
		of the informal processes and their interaction with the formal processes are
		analyzed in detail.  Recommendations towards efficient use of the positive
		aspects of informal communications for raising the overall effectiveness of
		scientific communication system are offered..
