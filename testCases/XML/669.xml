		  The Wiswesser chemical line-notation is an unique
		and unambiguous method of representing chemical
		structures by a linear series of letters, numbers,
		ampersands, and hyphens.  These symbols are meaningful to
		chemists familiar with the notation and can be processed
		by automatic data processing (ADP) equipment. 
		  The uniqueness of the line-notation permits the use
		of alphanumerically arranged lists of notations for
		dictionary-type searches.  This ordered arrangement
		permits the rapid location of a specific compound or a
		specific class of ring compounds other than benzenoid.
