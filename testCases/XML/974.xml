		   It was our original intention to include the cost of book selection with
		the cost of ordering, as part of the total acquisition process.  We also
		attempted to get indirect costs, such as rent and utilities.  Very few of
		the libraries were able to supply these figures so we based our survey on direct
		cost only.  We found from the preliminary survey that book selection statistics
		were extremely difficult to determine, since all the professional staff in the
		libraries concerned participated in book selection, with the chief librarian
		performing most of it.  As a result, the cost of book selection was exceedingly
		high and threw the cost of ordering out of proportion.
