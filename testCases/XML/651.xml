	<title>An Acquisitions Decision Model for Academic Libraries	</title>
	<author>DePew, John N.	</author>
	<text>
		   A decision model for book acquisitions has been developed to simulate the
		intellectual processes used in acquiring these materials in academic libraries..
		It consists of a flow chart, weighted inputs and an equation, which when solved
		indicates whether a library should add the title to its collection, refer it to
		a cooperative group, defer the decision or drop it altogether.. Inputs to the 
		model need further study and development, but the model is a step in defining
		and quantifying the decision process..
