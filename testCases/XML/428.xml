	<text>
		   This paper presents the analytical review of mathematical programming models
		that have been proposed as aids to the related problems of resources allocation 
		and project selection in RandD.. The models are classified according to whether
		they are based on linear, integer, chance constrained, or dynamic programming..
		Representative examples from these classes are described and evaluated in 
		detail.. The evaluation is on terms of data requirements; built-in assumptions;
		ease of computation; usefulness of outputs; versatility of application..
