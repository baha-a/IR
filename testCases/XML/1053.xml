		  This book is meant to be an aid and reference work
		for those people who are interested in the design of
		information systems.  Such information systems are
		typified by the traditional libraries, but the same
		problems of information processing, storage, and
		retrieval are present in many government and
		industrial organizations in many places besides the
		library.  This book provides an illustration of the
		tools, equipment, and methodology that might be
		applied to those problems.
