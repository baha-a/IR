		   With a view of obtaining a set of standard times for information system 
		operations, Aslib Research Department is developing and testing methods for 
		collecting and analyzing data on the time taken to perform certain operations..
		The current state of development of these methods is described.. Data collection
		is by a self-recording (diary) method, completed at the time of performing the 
		operation.. The major problem is one of identifying, describing, and analyzing 
		the effect of the various factors which might affect the time.. First results 
		indicate that it is possible to explain a large proportion of the variations in 
		individual times by taking account of a sufficient number of variables..
