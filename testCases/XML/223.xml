		   The standardized Document Delivery Tests (DDT's) developed earlier (Bulletin
		56: 241-267, July 1968) were employed to assess the capability of ninety-two
		medical school libraries for meeting the document needs of biomedical 
		researchers, and the capability of fifteen major resource libraries for filling 
		I-L requests from biomedical libraries.. The primary test data are summarized 
		as statistics on the observed availability status of the 300 plus documents in
		the test samples, and as measures expressing capability as a function of the 
		mean time that would be required for users to obtain test sample documents..
		A mathematical model is developed in which the virtual capability of a library,
		as seen by its users, equals the algebraic sum of the basic capability afforded
		by its holdings; the combined losses attributable to use of its collection, 
		processing, relative inaccessibility, and housekeeping problems; and the gain
		realized by coupling with other resources (I-L borrowing).. For a particular 
		library, or group of libraries, empirical values for each of these variables 
		can be  calculated easily from the capability measures and the status 
		statistics.. Regression equations are derived that provide useful predictions 
		of basic capability from collection size.. The most important result of this 
		work is that cost-effectiveness analyses can now be used as practical decision 
		aids in managing a basic library service.. A program of periodic surveys and 
		further development of DDT's is recommended as appropriate for the Medical 
		Library Association..
