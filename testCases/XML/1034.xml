	<title>Man's Aggression	</title>
	<author>Montagu, M.F.A.	</author>
	<text>
		  The purpose of this book is to inquire into the validity of the views
		on human nature expressed in the widely read and influential books
		of Robert Ardrey and Konrad Lorenz.  Ardrey's books are African
		Genesis (Atheneum, 1961), and The Territorial Imperative (Atheneum,
		1966).  Lorenz's book is On Aggression (Harcourt, Brace and World,
		1966).  In these books the authors argue that man is by
		instinct an aggressive creature, and it is this innate propensity to
		violence that accounts for individual and group aggression in man.
