	<title>Service to Industry and Research Parks by College and University Libraries	</title>

		  The phrase "research parks" in the title of this article recalls
		Eugene B. Jackson's 1961 prediction:
		
		In 1980 there will be universally-managed and industry-sponsored
		special libraries in the vicinity of the principal universities.  Their
		advanced use of new methods of bibliographic control, information
		retrieval, and data exchange will make their operations indistinguishable
		from those of special libraries of outstanding profit-making organizations
		in the same subject fields . . . Significant assessments will be
		made on the participating organization in research parts not only for
		the financing of day-to-day operations of facilities, especially set up
		for their benefit, but also for the total enrichment of the university
		library resources.
