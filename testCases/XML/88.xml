	<title>Patterns of Name Ordering among Authors of Scientific Papers:A study of Social Symbolism and Its Ambiguity	</title>

		   With increasing scientific collaboration, visibility of individual 
		role-performance has diminished.. Ordering of author' names as an adaptive 
		device which symbolizes their relative contributions to research.. Interviews 
		with Nobel laureates and comparisons of their name-order practices to those of 
		other scientists suggest that this symbol is ambiguous and makes evaluation of 
		individual role-performance difficult.. A probability model of expected 
		distribution of name orders is used in measuring preferences for particular 
		sequences, and these preferences vary with the authors' eminence.. On the 
		assumptions that authors' names are listed in order of the value of their 
		contributions, laureates should be first-authors more often than other 
		scientists; in fact, they are not.. Instead, they exercise their noblesse 
		oblige by giving credit to less eminent co-workers increasingly as their 
		eminence grows.. They do so more often after the prize, and eminent 
		laureates-to-be forego first-authorship more often than  those as yet 
		unrecognized.. The noblesse oblige, however, has its limits; laureates' 
		contributions to prize-winning research are more visible than contributions to 
		their other research..
