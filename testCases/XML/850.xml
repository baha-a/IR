		   Bell Telephone laboratories has established an on-line circulation system 
		linking two terminals in each of its three largest libraries to a central 
		computer.. Objectives include improved service through computer pooling of 
		collections, immediate reporting on publication availability or a borrower's 
		record, automatic reserve follow-up; reduced labor; and increased management 
		information.. Loans, returns, reserves and many queries are handled in real 
		time.. Input may be keyboard only or combined with card reading, to handle all 
		publications with borrower present or absent.. BELLREL is now being used for 
		some 1500 transactions per day..
