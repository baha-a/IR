		   An outline is given of the history of the Project and the development, with 
		OSTI support, of an information service in intestinal absorption which is intended
		to become self-supporting.. Results of an evaluation of computer-based current 
		awareness techniques including journal scanning is discussed with reference to 
		cost, completeness and minimum delay.. A simple technique is suggested for
		profile construction e.g. for Chemical Titles computer search, based on 
		frequency and specificity of words in a sample of relevant titles..
