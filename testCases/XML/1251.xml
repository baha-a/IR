		   This collection attempts to bring together a readable and germane group of
		materials ranging from history, review papers, and practical exposition to
		reports on current research and development and conjecture about the future.. 
		It is expected that these selections will be of interest and use to the 
		teacher and student.. It is also hoped that they will be of equal interest to
		the professional librarian and researcher.. There has been a deliberate attempt
		to exclude materials that have appeared in recently published collections..
		It is for this reason that the names of Panizzi, Cutter, Martel, Hanson,
		Dewey, Rider, Bliss, Haykin, Shera, Lubetzky and others do not appear.. A
		specific focus has been given to this book.. It is in the direction of a 
		rational sharing of local, national, and international efforts and the 
		eventual coordination and standardization of practices in the technical services
		insofar as this is practical..
