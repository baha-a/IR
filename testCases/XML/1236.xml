	<title>Public Libraries in Cooperative Systems; Administrative patterns for service	</title>
	<author>Gregory, R.W.	</author>
	<text>
		  This book was written as an introduction to the administrative
		relationships between small and medium-sized public libraries
		and the cooperative library system.  In this book, the definition
		of a cooperative system is as follows:  A cooperative library system
		is the combining of the talents and the resources of a group of
		independent libraries, within a reasonable geographic radius, for
		the purpose of attaining excellence in service and resources for
		the benefit of the actual and potential users of all the member
		libraries.  The plan for the book originated with questions directed
		to a public library administrator and to a system director.  The
		most pertinent of the repeated questions was, "How does system
		membership change local library administration?"  The sharpest
		question was, "Will the system ultimately take over local rights and
		responsibilities?"
