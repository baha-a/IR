		  The deterioration of library materials, constant since libraries began, has
		accelerated to alarming proportions in 1969.  Researchers have predicted that
		all paper-based records of this century, as well as those of earlier years,face
		imminent ruin.  Without new and effective efforts for their preservation, most
		will not be usable in their present form in the next century.  The danger of
		destruction threatens not only research library collections but also the world
		of knowledge and scholarship that they support. For not only paper is involved.
		Similar dangers of destruction confront other cellulosic products, such as
		film, which may substitute for paper as the material base of records.  And not
		only research libraries are involved. The surprisingly rapid deterioration of
		printed materials, even those that have been produced with some eye to 
		permanence, creates problems and expenses for other libraries as well.
