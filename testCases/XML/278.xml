		   Questions about the accuracy of library records, the behavior or attitudes
		of patrons, or the conditions of the books in the collection can often be 
		answered by a random sampling study.. Use of this time and money saving 
		technique requires no special mathematical ability or statistical background..
		The concept of accuracy is discussed and a table is provided to simplify the
		determination of an appropriate sample size.. A method of selecting a sample 
		using random numbers is shown.. Three examples illustrate the application of 
		the technique to library problems..
