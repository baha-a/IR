		   In this paper the experiences, costs, price policy, market, sales promotion
		and foreign cooperation of a Danish documentation department are described in
		relation to two databases, as follows: The COMPENDEX tapes are scanned in
		Denmark, whereas the INSPEC tapes are scanned in Holland with the inclusion of
		Danish profiles according to a bilateral agreement.. The total costs in 
		connection with COMPENDEX are evaluated and divided into four main components:
		Disbursement to the supplier of the tape system, working expenses of the 
		documentation center, costs of the electronic data processing, and expenses
		connected with the procurement of the original material to the subscribers..
		They can choose between including or deleting the COMPENDEX abstracts during
		sequential text scanning and printing-out.. Search profiles are formed by the 
		terms (word, author, journal code) connected by AND/OR/NOT-logic and weight
		factors.. (The above documentation department belongs to the National 
		Technological Library of Denmark and also two SDI services based on tape 
		systems from CAS.. Retrospective searches have been carried out)..
