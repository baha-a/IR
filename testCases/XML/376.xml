		  This publication describes and analyzes approximately 1750 organizations
		concerned with new forms, new media, and new methods for providing information
		services.  Among these organizations are publishers, computer software and time-
		sharing companies, micrographic firms, libraries, information centers, and 
		consultants.  The common interest of these diverse organizations is in service
		based on storage and representation of structured information with output on a
		recurring or demand basis.  The concept of information as used throughout this
		book is defined as data organized into a collection of facts and most often
		recorded in two basic forms: 1) textual data or literature, and 2) numeric
		data.
		  Roles played by the organizations described on the following pages vary but
		include one or more of the following functions: data base creation, data base
		publishing, data transmission, data manipulation and analysis, and data storage
		and retrieval.  Emphasis in this publication is on organizations involved in
		computerized services, micrographic applications, selective dissemination
		of information (SDI), and networking.
		  Not included in the Encyclopedia of Information Systems and Services are
		printed commercial and legal services, traditional academic and special 
		libraries, public information offices, hardware manufacturers and distributors
		within the computer and micrographic field, conventional indexing and 
		abstracting services, and most library automation programs which are limited
		to such housekeeping functions as circulation, serials control, and 
		acquisitions.
