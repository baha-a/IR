	<title>The Motivation to Work	</title>
	<author>Herzberg, F.	</author>
	<text>
		  This book reports the findings from a study of job motivation
		based on a fresh approach to this problem.  It is an important
		study, since the analyses and interpretations of the authors
		suggest that a breakthrough may well have been made to provide
		new insights into the nature and method of operation of job
		attitudes.
		  The senior authors were well prepared for their task, having
		recently completed a comprehensive review and analysis of the
		research in this field, reported in Job Attitudes: Review of
		Research and Opinion.  This review of several thousand articles
		and books regarding the factors relating to job attitudes and the
		effect of job attitudes on work performance indicated much
		disagreement and confusion in the field.  It appeared that one of
		the major contributors to this apparent diversity of results was
		the unstable nature of the subjective data on which studies in
		this field have been typically based.
