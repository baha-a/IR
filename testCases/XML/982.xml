		  The widespread introduction of electronic digital computer
		systems for information processing has produced significant
		advances in management theory and practice in recent years.
		For example, two management devices, PERT and CPM, undeveloped 
		and impractical before computers, have been basic to the success
		of our outer space program.  It is perhaps overlate in library
		development, but appropriate in this memorial to Miss Esther J.
		Piercy, to explore the application of new management knowledge
		and practice to the administration of libraries and information
		centers, and to sketch some directions in which research could be
		undertaken to benefit the management of information.
