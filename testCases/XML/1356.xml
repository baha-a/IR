	<title>The Scientist Versus Machine Search Services: We are the Missing Link	</title>
	<author>Maier, J.M.	</author>
	<text>
		  To take advantage of computerized data bases to improve their services to
		scientists without incurring prohibitive in-house expense, the librarians at 
		the  Boulder Laboratories have campaigned to increase awareness and utilization 
		via personal interviews, seminars, surveys, and critiques.  Data bases most 
		studied were DDC, NASA, SIE, ASCA, and the University of Georgia.  The 
		conclusions:  1) The scientist needs continuous  personal assistance by a 
		librarian or information specialist in order to make effective use of data 
		bases. 2) As local retailer, the librarian has an accordingly important role 
		to play now and in the future, a role at present generally ignored.
