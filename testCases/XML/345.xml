	<title>Data Bases; Computers, and the Social Sciences	</title>
	<author>Bisco, R.L.	</author>
	<text>
		  This book was written with several diverse audiences in mind: (1)
		social and behavioral scientists and their students, (2) librarians and
		library-science students who are favorable about employing computers
		and computer-usable information in their work and classes, and (3)
		archivists and their employees who desire to have more than a current
		overview of the problems and their tentative solutions.  Because of the
		diversity of material, it is not expected that all readers will use the book
		in the same way.  Rather, it is assumed that readers will supplement a
		subset of the book with bibliographical materials from the reference
		sections.
