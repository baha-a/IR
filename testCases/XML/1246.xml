		DEFINITION:  What is 'reader instruction'?  Another currently
		used term is 'library instruction', which puts the emphasis on 
		the library rather than the reader, and which also suggests to
		some that library instruction concerns the training of librarians.
		For the purpose of this introductory handbook 'reader instruction'
		is taken to mean instruction given to readers to help them make 
		the best use of a library, particularly an academic library of
		some size and complexity.
