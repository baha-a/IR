		   A high degree of constancy has been found to exist in the microstructure of 
		titles of samples of the INSPEC data-base taken over 3-year period.. Character
		and diagram frequencies are shown to be relatively stable, while variable-length
		character-string characterizing samples separated by 3 years in time show close
		similarities..
