		                The plan of this book follows our definition of organizations
		as social units that pursue specific goals which they are structured to
		serve, obviously under some social circumstances.  Therefore the book has
		three foci:  organizational goals; organizational structure; and organizations
		and their social environment.  Considerably more space is devoted to
		organizational structure than to the other topics, for two reasons:  First,
		more research has been conducted and more writings are available on
		organizational structure than on organizational goals (Chapter 2) and 
		environment.  Second, the major schools of organizational analysis have fixed
		their interests on structural aspects of the organization, and thus, we may
		best evaluate these different approaches in the context of organizational
		structure.
