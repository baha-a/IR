		  The field of documentation originated from the desire of librarians
		to arrange the document collection by subject areas.  Mono-Dicraredical
		Classification systems were developed for this purpose which made it
		possible in each case to find a single clearly defined category for each
		bibliographic item.  The development of modern science has brought about
		two principal changes in the situation:
		  First it is no longer enough to simply provide for the retrieval
		of complete bibliographic items as a unit, but rather one tends more and
		more to request informational details that may be contained in the book.
		Second, modern knowledge has become too complex and interdependent that it is 
		no longer possible to provide a single well-defined category for the books or
		journal articles.
