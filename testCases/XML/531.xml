		   Various approaches to index term weighting have been investigated.. In
		particular, claims have been made for the value of statistically-based
		indexing in automatic retrieval systems.. The paper discusses the logic of 
		different types of weighting, and describes experiments testing weighting 
		schemes of these types.. The result show that one type of weighting leads to
		material performance improvements in quite different collection environments..
