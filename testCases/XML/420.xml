	<title>The Automatic Creation of Literature Abstracts	</title>
	<author>Luhn, H.P.	</author>
	<text>
		   Experts of technical papers and magazine articles that serve the purposes of
		conventional abstracts have been created entirely by automatic means.. In the
		exploratory research described, the complete text of an article in machine-
		readable form is scanned by an IBM 704 data-processing machine and analyzed 
		in accordance with a standard program..  Statistical information derived from 
		word frequency and distribution is used by the machine to compute a relative 
		measure of significance, first for individual words and then for sentences..
		Sentences scoring highest in significance are extracted and printed out to 
		become the "auto-abstract"..
