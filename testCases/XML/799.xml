		   Patterns of searching in library catalogues were analysed,using the data 
		from a large survey of the use of three university library and one public 
		library catalogues.. 'Known-item' searches were the object of the study..
		Success or failure of the search was correlated to degree of correctness and
		completeness of the searcher's information about title and author of the item 
		that he wished to locate.. Factors involved in searching strategies were 
		discussed.. The double role played by both the title and the author as a way of 
		access to the catalogue and as a means for identifying the right entry was 
		examined..
