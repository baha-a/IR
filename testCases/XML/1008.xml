	<title>The Measurement and Evaluation of Reference Service	</title>
	<author>Rothstein, S.	</author>
	<text>
		        The measurement and evaluation of reference service
		has been more often discussed than attempted.  In fact, the 
		literature of this subject has itself spawned a fair-sized 
		literature of review.
		        Admittedly, the task is formidable.  As compared with 
		other library activities such as circulation, acquisitions, and
		cataloging, reference service is ill-defined, with little
		agreement on its component parts.  Is inter-library lending an
		integral part of reference work because many reference librarians
		are responsible for it?  Formal instruction in the use of books
		and libraries?  The supervision of reference reading rooms?  The
		preparation of indexes?  And having decided what the genus 
		"reference librarian" does, how can one readily determine the
		effectiveness of his work or its impact?  Reference librarians
		may have acted rather blindly in approaching their elephant of a
		problem, but it is undeniably a big one.
