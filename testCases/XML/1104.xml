	<title>Current Awareness Bibliographies in the State Information System	</title>
	<author>Briskman, M.A.	</author>
	<text>
		   Notes that at present the current awareness bibliography of Soviet
		publications (which is provided, in some form or other almost in all of the 
		areas of knowledge, production, or culture) fails to ensure complete enough
		information even with respect to directly related literature.  A set of
		measures are suggested, aimed at a cardinal improvement of the listings in the
		state bibliography system..
