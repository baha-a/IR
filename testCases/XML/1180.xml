	<title>A Notation for Coding Organic Compounds	</title>
	<author>Geivandov, E. A.	</author>
	<text>
		   A notation for coding organic structures has been developed which provides
		for very simple and rational rules of coding the common cyclic fragments..
		   The conventional unit used in coding regular structures is benzol ring, and
		the skeleton of the regular condensed system is coded using a sequence of even
		and odd integers.. The set of rules for coding regular systems might be used as
		component of a universal notation for organic compounds.. The code offered by
		the author is designed to cover an important and broad class of compounds with
		conjugate bonds and it can be used within the framework of a specialized 
		computer-based information retrieval system in the capacity of both the input 
		and the internal machine language..
