   A computerized serials record and control system developed in 1968/69 for the
Technical Information Department of Pfizer Inc. is described and subjected to a 
cost analysis.. This cost analysis is conducted in the context of an investment
decision, using the concept of net present value, a method not previously used 
in library literature.. The cost analysis reveals a positive net present value
and a system life break-even requirement of seven years at a 10% cost of 
capital.. This demonstrates that such an automated system can be economically
justifiable in a library of relatively modest size (approx. 1,100 serial and
periodical titles).. It may be that the break-even point in terms of collection
size required for successful automation of serial records is smaller than has 
been assumed to date..
