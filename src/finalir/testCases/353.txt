The Development of Reference Services through Academic Traditions,Public Library Practice and Special Librarianship

Rothstein, S.

  Modern American library history has received only sporadic attention as a
subject for investigation.  Though we have now accumulated an adequate supply
of source materials to draw upon in the form of annual reports, service 
studies, biographical accounts, and chronicles of individual libraries,
no one has yet fashioned out of these materials a critical history of American
librarianship.  To paraphrase Leo LaMontagne, we have salvaged remnants from
the past, but we have yet to convert them into history.
  The lack has cost the profession dearly.  Even a casual survey of the
literature of librarianship reveals the shocking degree of duplication and
naivete that stem from an insufficient awareness of previous efforts.
  There is clearly room and need for a series of evaluative studies of the 
development of American library services which could eventually be put
together to form the desired definitive history of American librarianship.
The present dissertation is intended as a contribution toward that end.  It
undertakes to furnish the historical background for one of the continuing
problems of American librarianship - the provision of reference services in
research libraries.
