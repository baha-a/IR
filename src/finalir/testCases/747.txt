The Law of Constant Citation for Scientific Literature

Gomperts, M. C.

   In listing the literature concerning the subject of 'vibrating plates' the
following law was noticed:
            Rj x aj,t = constant = 5x6
where Rj is the 'citation factor' for the year, j, and aj,t stands for the 
total number of articles that have appeared up to and including year j..
   'This 'citation law' is based on the remarkable fact that in more than 150
years the mean number of relevant citations per article per year has remained
constant, viz. 2x8, in spite of the fact that after 1950 three times as many
articles have been published as in the period before 1950..
