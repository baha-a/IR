Automatic Indexing Using Bibliographic Citations

Salton, G.

   Bibliographic citations attached to technical documents have been used 
variously to refer to related items in the literature, to confer importance to 
a given piece of writing, and to serve as supplementary indications of document
content..In the present study, citations are used directly to identify document
content, and an attempt is made to evaluate their effectiveness in a retrieval 
environment.. It is shown that the use of bibliographic citations in addition 
to the normal keyword-type indicators produces improved retrieval performance, 
and that in some circumstances, citations are more effective for retrieval 
purposes than other more conventional terms and concepts..
