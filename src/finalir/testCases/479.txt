Automatic Term Classifications and Retrieval

Sparck-Jones, K.Needham, R. M.

   Recent research at the Cambridge Language Research Unit has been concerned 
with the application of the automatic classification techniques associated with 
the "theory of clumps" to document description obtained from the Aslib-Cranfield
project, and with the use of the resulting term classifications in retrieval..
A substantial program engine has been developed which computes similarities 
between pairs of terms on the basis of their occurrences and co-occurrences in 
document descriptions, and finds classes of terms with strong similarity 
connections by minimizing the cohesion between a potential clump and its 
complement; and which retrieves using single terms and/or term classes 
according to specification, and calculates recall and precision ratios for sets 
of requests.. Serious tests with different similarity and clump definitions and 
with different modes of using term classes are still in progress, so on 
definite conclusions about the value of this kind of classification are 
presented..
