Formal Languages

Salomaa, A.

  This book develops a theory of formal languages from the point of view of
generative devices, mainly grammars.  Recognition devices, automata, are
introduced only as a secondary tool and are themselves presented within the
framework of rewriting systems.
  The main emphasis is on mathematical aspects of formal languages rather
than application.  People interested only in applications to programming
languages (resp. natural languages) would certainly prefer a more
comprehensive discussion on topics such as LR(k) grammars (resp. 
transformational grammars).  Such discussions lie outside the scope of
this book.
