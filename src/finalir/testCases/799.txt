Access and Recognition: from User's Data to Cataloque Entries

Tagliacozzo, RenataRosenberg, LawrenceKochen, Manfred

   Patterns of searching in library catalogues were analysed,using the data 
from a large survey of the use of three university library and one public 
library catalogues.. 'Known-item' searches were the object of the study..
Success or failure of the search was correlated to degree of correctness and
completeness of the searcher's information about title and author of the item 
that he wished to locate.. Factors involved in searching strategies were 
discussed.. The double role played by both the title and the author as a way of 
access to the catalogue and as a means for identifying the right entry was 
examined..
