Human Problem Solving

Newell, A.Simon, H.A.

    The present study is concerned with the performance of intelligent adults
in our own culture.  The tasks discussed are short (half-hour), moderately
difficult problems of a symbolic nature.  The three main tasks we use - chess,
symbolic logic, and algebra-like puzzles (called cryptarithmetic puzzles) -
typify this class of problems.  The study is concerned with the integrated
activities that constitute problem solving.  It is not centrally concerned
with perception, motor skill, or what are called personality variables.
The study is concerned primarily with performance, only a little with
learning, and not at all with development or differences related to age.
Finally, it is concerned with integrated activities, hence deemphasizes the
details of processing on the time scale of elementary reactions (that is,
half a second or less).  Similarly, long-term integrated activities extending
over periods of days or years receive no attention.
