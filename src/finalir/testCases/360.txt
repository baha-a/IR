  The current need for a manual of copying methods dealing with the processes, 
methods, techniques, and types of equipment which can be used for reproducing 
documents of a great many different kinds arises from two factors: 
  (1) The great importance of document reproduction processes in the 
acquisition, preservation, dissemination, and communication of information vital
to the conduct of research work in all fields of human endeavor and on an
international scale.
  (2) The complexity of the field of document reproduction today which has 
resulted from the enormous technical advances made in the past fifteen years.
