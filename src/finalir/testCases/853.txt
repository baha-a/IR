the accuracy of donnell's equations .
  solutions of donnell's equations of the small
deformations of the perfectly elastic thin-walled circular
cylindrical shell are compared with those obtainable from flugge's
equations .  the range of the basic parameters is found
within which the two solutions are approximately equal .
