   In July 1966, the Institute for Advancement of Medical Communication began
work on a project aimed at developing methods for collecting objective data
suitable for planning and guiding local, regional, and national programs to 
improve biomedical libraries and the biomedical information complex.. This
article constitutes an introduction to a series of reports on the methodologic
tools that have been developed.. It describes the overall purpose and initial 
goals of the project, gives the general plan of the work, and presents five
basic concepts that underlie the project's approach and structure the entire
effort..
