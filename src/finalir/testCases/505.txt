Five Years, Five Volumes and 2345 Pages   of the Annual Review of Information Science and Technology

Saracevic, Tefko

   The Annual Review of Information Science and Technology (ARIST) is now 5
years old.. In these 5 years ARIST became not only a very much used and quoted 
tool, but also an established institution.. This is testified by the fact that 
each of the five volumes was the year's most frequently and most comprehensively
reviewed book in the field.. The ARIST effort is unparalleled in great many 
fields..
   Currently we are entering an era of intense concern about and reactions to
science and technology.. All sciences and technologies are subject to 
questioning, scrutiny and evaluation both inside and outside of their subject 
areas..
   Scrutiny of a field may be attempted by a scrutiny of its important 
literature items.. With 5 years and five volumes ARIST invites and affords a 
perspective.. This review is attempting in broad brushstrokes to be a critical 
examination of the underlying structure, and literature base as well as the 
achievements of the ARIST effort as a whole..
