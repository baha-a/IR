The Foreign-Language Problem Facing Scientists and Technologists in the United Kingdom - Report of a Recent Survey

Wood, D. N.

   The foreign-language barrier facing British scientists is a function of a,
the amount and value of foreign scientific literature produced; b, the 
linguistic ability of the people wishing to read it; and c, the availability
and effectiveness of translation services.. To obtain quantitative data on 
these points the NLL has recently conducted a survey amongst scientists and
librarians in the United Kingdom and the present paper presents the more
important results..
   The survey has shown that the language problem is of considerable magnitude
and is common to the majority of scientists and technologists.. The languages
creating the most difficulty are Russian, German, and Japanese.. It has also 
indicated that local translation facilities are not particularly effective and 
that, as far as national facilities are concerned, British scientists are 
largely unaware of existing services which might help them to overcome their 
difficulties..
   The results of the investigation suggest a number of lines of action which 
the appropriate authorities might follow..  The most important would seem to be
the publishing of a international index to translations and the creation within 
the United Kingdom of a centralized Japanese translation service..
