The CA Integrated Subject File.  II. Evaluation of Alternative Data Base Organizations

  The relative retrieval performances of the CA Integrated Subject File (CAISF),
CA Condensates, and a Merged File created from these two data bases have been
measured.  Retrieval performance is reported in terms of recall and precision
values as well as costs.  The precision and recall retrieval failures - i.e.,
irrelevant documents and missed documents - have been analyzed for each data
base and characterized according to the five major types of failures: index 
language, indexing, searching, clerical, and miscellaneous.  Over-all analysis
of the performance suggests that an effective data base can be created by
augmenting the CA Condensates data base with Registry Numbers and some
representation of the CAISF General Subject concept headings, which results
in a file approximately half the size of the corresponding CAISF data base
and is suitable for search using existing retrieval system software.
