Journal Usage Versus Age of Journal

Cole, P.F.

  The effective planning of technical libraries would be greatly facilitated
if there were some theoretical basis which could be used to predict the
probable distribution by titles, and by age of journal, of future journal
demand.  As a first step, the author has recently developed a general expression
for the distribution among journal titles of large groups of journal references.
In this present paper a relationship between usage and age of journal
is established and the application of this relationship to some library planning
problems is illustrated.
