Rossler, SigridKolb, Arthur

   The Genealogical Retrieval by Magnetic Tapes Storage (GREMAS) system and the
potential it offers for searches are described.. The input and retrieval 
procedures of the system are explained as well as the integration of the GREMAS 
system into the IDC system - i.e., machine generation of the GREMAS coding from
topological input and of the superimposed bit code from the GREMAS coding..
