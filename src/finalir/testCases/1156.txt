This article presents the results of a study of the information requests of
inquirers. It was elucidated that engineers spent an average of 10 hours per 
week in search of needed information. Most valuable sources of information are 
theoretical journals. The study showed that "stable life" of theoretical 
journals equals about 12 years and information journals about 5-6 years. Some
recommendations were formulated on how to construct a reference information
collection.
