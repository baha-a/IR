On the Articulation of Surrogates:  An Attempt at an EpistemologicalFoundation

Perreault, J.M.

  There are two major purposes, in mind, for this gathering.  The first is the
most general that can be proposed for any gathering: the simple advantage of
bringing together those who have been at work on a single problem or at least
a small class of problems - especially when this problem has not previously
benefited from exclusive and thematic collaboration among its investigators.
To further such thematic collaboration, the formal presentations have been
scheduled no more than three each day, with time left after each presentation
for (formal) discussion here in the conference room, and with as much time as
possible - given the number of presentations - left free for informal 
discussion. 
  The second purpose is one of even greater necessity, in my opinion, though
one not so obvious as the first.  Over and above the hope for interchange of
what has already been thought out - in the form of personal contact, where
the presence of the originator of the system or theory can reinforce the
printed word in its usual and ineffable way - it is my hope that we will all
be able (especially in our informal discussions) to penetrate beyond mere
similarity and difference to the underlying philosophical bases of syntactic
relationship.
