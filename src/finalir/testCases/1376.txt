Williams, M.E.

  Libraries, as potential users of bibliographic data base services, will need 
to evaluate not only the contents of the many data bases available but the
different services provided by various processing centers.  Criteria for 
selection of data bases and data base services such as searching features, 
logical capacity, document delivery, output format and medium, and costs are 
examined.
