Similarity Relations and Fuzzy Orderings

Zaden, L. A.

   The notion of "similarity" as defined in this paper is essentially a 
generalization of the notion of equivalence.. In the same vein, a fuzzy ordering
is a generalization of the concept of ordering.. For example, the relation 
x >> y is a fuzzy linear ordering in the set of real numbers..
   More correctly, a similarity relation, S is a fuzzy relation which is
reflexive, symmetric, and transitive..
   Various properties of similarity relations and fuzzy ordering are 
investigated and, as an illustration, an extended version of Szpilrajn's 
theorem is proved..
