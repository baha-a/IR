BIBCON - A General Purpose Software System for MARC-Based Book CatalogProduction

Gibson, Liz

   The BIBCON file management system, designed for use on IBM 360 system 
equipment, performs two basic functions: (1) it creates MARC structured, 
bibliographic records from untagged input data; (2) from these records it 
produces page image output for book catalogs.. The system accepts data from
several different input devices and can produce a variety of output formats by 
line printer, photocomposition, or computer output microform (COM)..
