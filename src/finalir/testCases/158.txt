Standard Costing for Information Systems:Background to a Current Study

  For some time past, interest has been developing within the Aslib Research
Department in the problems of establishing standard costs for information
systems.  A literature search recently conducted by the Department (R.
Reynolds) has revealed a scarcity of usable information on this subject:
such data as is available is difficult to evaluate comparatively because
of the differing definitions of the operations costed and of the terms used to
describe them.  It would seem, therefore, that a first step towards developing
a costing method of widespread application would be the establishment of
standard conventions for the analysis of information systems.
  One might postulate two possible ways of arriving at comparative costs for
these systems, namely:
(a) General survey method:  The overall costs of a large number of information
    systems are broken down into a small number of categories, and analysed
    for correlation (see, for example, C.J. Wessel et al).
(b) In-depth study:  A small number of systems are studied in detail in an
    attempt to establish the true sources of the costs and factors affecting
    them.
  In a current project, we are attempting to apply method (b) to the production
of current-awareness bulletins.  An outline of some of the preliminary work in
this project follows.
