The Planning of Academic and Research Library Buildings

Metcalf, K.D.

  This volume deals with the planning of academic
and research library buildings.  Library buildings
house library collections of various kinds, chiefly
books and other printed matter; seating accommodations
and other facilities for library users; quarters for
the library staff that acquires, catalogues, and serves
the collections; and, in addition, architectural or
what is preferably known as non-assignable space.
(If there if space left over after caring for the
above needs, it is sometimes assigned for other
purposes.)
