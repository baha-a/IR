Optimal Resource Allocation in Library Systems

Rouse, William B.

   A procedure is developed for optimal allocation of resources among the many
processes of a library system.. Queueing theory is used to model processes as
either waiting or balking processes.. The optimal allocation of resources to 
these processes is defined as that which maximizes the expected value of the
decision-maker's utility function.. An application of the procedure to a 
specific library system is discussed..
