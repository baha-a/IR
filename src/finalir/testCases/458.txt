Information Retrieval Systems

Lancaster, F.W.

  This book is concerned primarily with those "intellectual" factors that
significantly affect the performance of all information retrieval systems;
namely,

        - indexing policy and practice
        - vocabulary control
        - searching strategies
        - interaction between the system and its users

  My viewpoint is that of the evaluator of information systems.  I have
therefore paid considerable attention to a discussion of the requirements
of users of information systems and the measurement of system performance
in terms of the efficient and economical satisfaction of these requirements.
  The book does not concern itself, except indirectly, with equipment
for the implementation of retrieval systems, a topic that is adequately
covered by other volumes in this seris.  Moreover, it is my contention that
the importance of "hardware" and "data processing" aspects of information
systems has been exaggerated in the United States, with some detriment
to the performance of many systems.
