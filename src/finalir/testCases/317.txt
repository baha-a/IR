Natural Language Question - Answering System: 1969

Simmons, Robert F.

   Recent experiments in programming natural language question-answering system
are reviewed to summarize the methods that have been developed for syntactic, 
semantic, and logical analysis of English strings.. It is concluded that at
least minimally effective  techniques have been devised for answering questions
from natural language subsets in small scale experimental systems and that a 
useful paradigm has evolved to guide research efforts in the field.. Current 
approaches to semantic analysis and logical inference are seen to be effective 
beginnings but of questionable generality with respect either to subtle aspects
of meaning or to applications over large subset of English.. Generalizing from
current small-scale experiments to language processing systems based on 
dictionaries with thousands of entries - with correspondingly large grammars 
and semantic systems - may entail a new order of complexity and require the 
invention and development of entirely different approaches to semantic analysis 
and question answering..
