Garfield, Eugene

   The unique features  of the "references cited" in U.S. patents are discussed 
in relation to their  use in the patent section of the Science Citation Index, 
which adds a new dimension to patent searching.. Citation indexing provides a 
new basis for clarifying the concepts of similarity, coupling, novelty, and 
relevance..
