Educating the Library User

Lubans, J.

  Educating the Library User is a collection of original essays, case
studies, and research reports on the problems, hopes, and techniques of 
instructing library users and nonusers, from the kindergartener to the 
preschool adult, in the effective use of libraries and their resources.
Merging the library-use teachings of school, public, and academic
libraries, this book demonstrates the need for a consistent, sequential
plan of library-use instruction that crosses traditional library boundaries.
