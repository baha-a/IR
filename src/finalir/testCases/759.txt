A New Look at Reference Scattering

Cole, P.F.

  It was first observed by Bradford that, for a large collection of journal
references on a given subject, most of the articles are derived from a small
proportion of the total titles.  Bradford listed the journals concerned in order
of decreasing productivity and, by plotting the logarithms of the cumulative
totals of titles against the cumulative totals of relevant articles produced,
he obtained a straight line.  (Similar results have been obtained by many later
workers.  The pattern is illustrated by Table I which shows the distribution
of references among journal titles obtained by the author during a study of
literature usage in the petroleum industry.)  On the basis of these results
Bradford then formulated a simple mathematical model to describe reference
scattering.  Vickery later pointed out that this 'law of scattering' predicted
not a straight line but a curve.  Kendall has now provided a more refined
statistical explanation of the straight line observed by Bradford.
