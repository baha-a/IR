Kessler, M.M.

   The methods of bibliographic coupling were applied to 8186 papers in thirty-
five volumes of the Physical Review (Vol. 77, 1950 to Vol. 111, 1958).. The 
results are reported in the form of ten case histories.. Each case was chosen 
to illustrate a problem in information retrieval..
