Evaluating the Economic Efficiency of a Document Retrieval System

Lancaster, F. W.Climenson, W. D.

   A retrieval system may be evaluated strictly in terms of user satisfaction
(operating efficiency), or it may be evaluated from the point of view of
efficient means of satisfying user requirements (economic efficiency).. When
we consider the relationship between operating efficiency and economic 
efficiency, we are faced with a whole series of possible trade-offs.. There
may be several alternative paths we can follow in order to serve user needs..
The problem is to determine the most economical path to follow.. Pay-off
factors, break-even points, and diminishing returns must be taken into 
consideration.. This paper considers some of these factors in relation to various
parts of the complete retrieval system: the acquisition subsystem, the indexing 
subsystem, the index language, the searching subsystem, and the equipment 
subsystem..
