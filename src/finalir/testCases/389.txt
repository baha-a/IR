Factors Determining the Performance of Indexing Systems

Cleverdon, C.W..BVol. 1

  The original Aslib-Cranfield investigations on the efficiency of indexing
systems (references 1, 2 and 3) did not, by itself, produce firm answers to 
what is one of the basic problems in information retrieval, namely the 
decision as to which index language should be used.  Certainly it did not, as 
some people had anticipated, demonstrate that one system was 'better' than 
another, either  generally, or in any given situation.
