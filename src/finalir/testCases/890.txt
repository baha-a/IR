   This paper reports the application of pattern recognition and substructural 
analysis to the problem of predicting the antineoplastic activity of 24 test 
compounds in an experimental mouse brain tumor system based on 138 structurally
diverse compounds tested in this tumor system.. The molecules were represented 
by three types of substructural fragments, the augmented atom, the heteropath, 
and the ring fragments.. Of the two pattern recognition methods used to predict
the activity of the test compounds the nearest neighbor method predicted 83%
correctly while the learning machine  method predicted 92% correctly.. The test
structures and the important substructural fragments used in this study are 
given and the implications of these results are discussed..
