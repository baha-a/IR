Allocating the Book Budget: A Model

Kohut, Joseph J.

   Inflation is currently affected library book budgets, particularly with 
respect to the acquisition of serials.. A model is proposed which would balance
the purchase of serials against the purchase of monographs by individual 
funding units within the academic library.. Special consideration is given to 
inflation as a cost factor affected by both the form of publication and the 
subject matter.. Applying the model to a specific example demonstrates its use 
in providing control over collection development and allowing for equitable 
distribution of book funds among funding units..
