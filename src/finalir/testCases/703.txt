A Chemical Search System for a Small Computer

Wilde, D.U.Starke, A.C.

  The mechanization of chemical information retrieval systems until now has been
limited to those organizations that have access to extensive computer 
facilities.  Now, small, low-cost computers, such as IBM's 1130 or DEC's PDP-11,
are available with input/output capacities that make them suitable for SDI
and retrospective searching  on any of the many commercially available data
bases.  Such a machine, located at the New England Research Application Center 
(NERAC), is described and the problems of using it for chemical information
retrieval are discussed.  NERAC's SDI Chemical Search System is described,
and an example profile is used to illustrate its capabilities.
