A Business Intelligence System

Luhn, H.P.

   An automatic system is being developed to disseminate information to the 
various sections of any industrial, scientific or government organization.. 
This intelligence system will utilize data-processing machines for auto-
abstracting and auto-encoding of documents and for creating interest profiles
for each of the "action points" in an organization.. Both incoming and 
internally generated documents are automatically abstracted, characterized by a
word pattern, and sent automatically to appropriate action points.. This paper
shows the flexibility of such a system in identifying known information, in
finding who needs to know it and in disseminating it efficiently either in 
abstract form or as a complete document..
