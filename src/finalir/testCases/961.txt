An Operations Research Study of a Variable Loan and Duplication Policy at the University of Lancaster

Buckland, Michael K.

   The Library Research Unit of the University of Lancaster used an Operations
Research (O.R.) approach to recommend changes in loan and duplication policies 
in the university library.. The "variable" loan and duplication policy which was
developed is described and also the considerable impact of implementation.. 
Other libraries are now adopting this kind of policy.. The work is presented as 
a case study in library O.R. .. The great importance of analyzing the structure
of problems is stressed and the nature and usefulness of models is described..
For the most useful results, suitable librarians should be included in the
research team..
