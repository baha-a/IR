The Parametric Description of Retrieval TestsPart I: The Basic Parameters

Robertson, S.E.

   Some parameters and techniques in use for describing the results of tests 
on IR systems are analysed.. Several considerations outside the score of the 
usual 2x2 table are relevant to the choice of parameters.. In particular, a
variable which produces a 'performance curve' of a system corresponds to an
extension of the 2x2 table.. Also, the statistical relationships between
parameters are all-important.. It is considered that precision is not such a
useful measure of performance (in conjunction with recall) as fallout.. A more
powerful alternative to Cleverdon's 'inevitable inverse relationship between
recall and precision' is proposed and justified, namely that the recall-fallout
graph is convex..
