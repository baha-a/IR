A Chemical Structure Storage and Search System Developed at Du Pont

Gluck, D.J.

  As early as 1961, we in the engineering Department of
Du Pont recognized the need for a better system for
recording chemical structure information for storage and
subsequent retrieval.  We believed that current methods
and the then current development of notation systems
would not completely serve our chemists' long range
chemical identification needs.
  Accordingly, we studied and then developed a chemical
structure storage and search system.  Huber gave a good
review of the various approaches and applications.  To use
his terminology, our system is topological coding.
  Our initial investigation led to singling out the following
needs for such a system.
