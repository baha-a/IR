International Developments in Cataloging

Anderson, Dorothy

   The IFLA Committee on Cataloging has been at work since 1954 to establish 
international standards for cataloging and bibliographic records; it was 
responsible for the International Conference on Cataloging Principles, Paris, 
1961, and and the International Meeting of Cataloging Experts, Copenhagen, 
1969.. In recent years there have been increasing demands from national 
cataloging bodies and bibliographic agencies for uniformity in codes and 
practices, and in consequence there has been more willingness to make national 
concessions in order to reach international standards.. The IFLA Cataloging
Secretariat was established in 1971 to assist this trend by co-ordinating work,
promoting new projects and acting as a liaison center..
