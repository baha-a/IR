Library Planning and Decision Making Systems

Hamburg, M.

  The research project which produced this book concentrated on the problem
of the design and development of statistical information systems that would
provide quantitative information for effective management of university and
large public libraries.  Since there is an inseparable need not only for
improved library statistical data systems but also for the above-mentioned
frameworks for rational planning and decision making, we have devoted
considerable effort to the development of analytical models that might assist
library administrators in making decisions that would maximize the flow of
benefits imparted to the communities the library serves.  Some of the results of
this model-building effort are repored in these pages.
