Information Retrieval On-Line

Lancaster, F.W.

    This book deals with on-line systems for bibliographic search and
retrieval.  The literature on this subject is increasing rapidly and new systems
are appearing all the time.  We have attempted to provide a broad survey of
the characteristics, capabilities, and limitations of present systems.  Our
emphasis is on the design, evaluation, and use of on-line retrieval systems,
primarily from the viewpoint of the planner and manager of information
services.  It is oriented toward the "intellectual" aspects of information
retrieval rather than the hardware or programming aspects.  We hope that
this book may have some value for all students of library and information
science.
