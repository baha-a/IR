   The selectivity, timeliness and quality of indexing of a commercial service 
may be assessed by comparing the journal articles chosen by an organization as 
relevant to its interests, with those subsequently reported by the service..
These aspects were evaluated with respect to Drugdoc which scans over 3400
biomedical journals.. The results showed that the selection criteria laid down 
by Drugdoc are strictly adhered to; the mean time of alerting of an article 
was 11-3 weeks after receipt of the journal at Wellcome and all articles from a
particular journal issue were reported by Drugdoc on average within 13-6 
weeks.. Indexing was examined in detail and on average 8-1 primary 
thesaurus-controlled indexing terms were assigned per article.. Pilot studies
were also run on SDI profiles compiled from the Drugdoc Thesaurus..
