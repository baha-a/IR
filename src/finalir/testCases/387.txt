The Foundations of Education for Librarianship

Shera, J.H.

    The study is a result of a theory of librarianship which has been in the
process of maturation for more than a quarter century of teaching and
administration, first at the University of Chicago, and subsequently at Western
Reserve University, now Case Western Reserve University, and which has
been elaborated in essays and addresses as the inquiry progressed.
    My purpose has been to explore the role of the library as it contributes
to the total communication system in society and the meaning of that role
for the library profession, and having determined the requirements of that
role to identify those which are appropriately met by graduate professional
education.  Therefore, the inquiry begins with a consideration of the
communication system within the individual as related to his physiological,
neurological, and psychological structure, and its meaning for learning and
reading patterns and characteristics.  The study then progresses to an
exposition of the cultural environment and its communication system in society,
together with the place of the library in it.
