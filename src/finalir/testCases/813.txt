   The choice of the suitable data base for providing an information service is
governed by factors of coverage, performance, and cost.. The cost of the data 
base to subscribers is a known quantity, and the coverage is decided by the data
base producers..
   This paper describes an investigation into the relative performance of the
four major Chemical Abstracts Service magnetic tape data-base, Chemical Titles 
(CT), which contains the titles of citations only, Chemical Abstracts 
Condensates (CAC), which contains titles enriched with keyword phrases,
Chemical-Biological Activities (CBAC),and Polymer Science and Technology (POST),
both of which contain full digests in addition to titles..
   The performance was measured in terms of the relative currency of the four
data-bases, on the retrieval efficiency of profiles searched against them.. 
Fifty questions from industrial and government research organizations were used 
in the experiment.. Search profiles corresponding to these questions were
constructed for searching against each database, output was assessed for 
relevance by users, and profile performance figures (precision and recall 
ratios) were calculated for each profile.. The overall retrieval efficiency of
profiles searched against data-bases containing titles only,
titles-plus-keywords, and titles-plus-digests, was calculated, and these results 
are presented..
