a small deflection theory for curved sandwich plates .
  a small-deflection theory that takes into account deformations
due to transverse shear is presented for the elastic-behavior
analysis of orthotropic plates of constant cylindrical curvature
with considerations of buckling included .  the theory is
applicable primarily to sandwich construction .
