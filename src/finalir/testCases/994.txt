Measuring Reader Failure at the Catalogue

Seymour, Carol A.Schofield, J. L.

   In an effort to develop a simple method for librarians to employ to measure
and evaluate author catalogue use, the Library Management Research Unit tested
a survey design in four varying libraries.. The reader was asked to note details
of items not found in the catalogue, the source of the reference, and his 
status.. The items were then checked by library staff to discover the cause of
"failure".. Library staff interviewed samples of catalogue users to determine 
the overall rate of "failure", the cooperation (with "Catalogue Query Slips") 
rate, and the action readers proposed to take in order to obtain the item(s) not
found in the catalogue..
