   In a previous paper from The Wellcome Foundation (Scott et al., 1971) a

by comparing the choice of papers and of indexing terms to those chosen as
relevant to the organization.. In this paper we are comparing the cost 
effectiveness of several commercial data bases, journal scanning by information 
scientists, and the impact of private communication..
