Standera, Oldrich R.

   With budget constraints, the problems of cost and effectiveness have 
advanced to the top of priority list of all information services managers..
Determining and monitoring effectiveness should be cost-effective also..
   The author traces the cost-effectiveness problems back to the genesis of an 
information system.. Performance parameters and their shifting in the desired 
direction are briefly discussed.. The monthly statement is intended to assist a
manager in budgeting and planning and it should also alert him to any 
irregularities in costs and effectiveness, either in time or among individual 
services.. If adopted more widely it could even serve as a means of comparison 
between centers if due consideration is given to varying conditions..
