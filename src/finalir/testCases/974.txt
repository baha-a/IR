Cost Survey:Cost of Ordering, Cataloging, and Preparations in Southern CaliforniaLibraries

MacQuarrie, C.

   It was our original intention to include the cost of book selection with
the cost of ordering, as part of the total acquisition process.  We also
attempted to get indirect costs, such as rent and utilities.  Very few of
the libraries were able to supply these figures so we based our survey on direct
cost only.  We found from the preliminary survey that book selection statistics
were extremely difficult to determine, since all the professional staff in the
libraries concerned participated in book selection, with the chief librarian
performing most of it.  As a result, the cost of book selection was exceedingly
high and threw the cost of ordering out of proportion.
