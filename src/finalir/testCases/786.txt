Documentation Notes

Zipf, Library

   A recent article by Kozachkov and Khursin, entitled 'The basic probability
distribution in information flow systems', describes the fundamental similarity
of a number of known statistical regularities in the flow of information.. They
propose a basic model, called the 'hyperbolic ladder' and relate it, in 
particular, to work in linguistics by Zipf, in documentation by Bradford, and
in the science of science by Lotka.. The purpose of this note is to speculate 
further on the relevance of Zipf's law in librarianship..
