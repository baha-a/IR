Economies and Computers

Sharpe, W.F.

  It is not a simple matter to describe this book.  Briefly, it
attempts to provide and apply a set of concepts from economic theory
that may prove valuable to those who are now or may become decision-
makers in the selection, financing, and/or use of computers.  Only
theory relevant for such decision-makers is presented here.  This means
that the effects of computers on the economy as a whole lie outside
the scope of this book, as do a number of related issues.  We deal,
thus, with microeconomic, not macroeconomic, theory: our focus is on the
small (industry, firm, computer) and not the large (gross national
product, consumer price index, unemployment).
