Functional Approach

Sgall, P.

  The present book sums up a certain stage in the research on algebraic
linguistics being pursued at Charles University, Prague.  It is based mainly
on P. Sgall's book (1967a, in Czech), which represents the first attempt at a
systematic formulation of the conception of generative description that has
gradually been elaborated by our research group.
  We do not claim that any particular question has been answered here in a
definitive way, but the conception of a generative system based on an
articulation of the semantic relation (see Section 1.3.4) may perhaps be
interesting in connection with the present development of algebraic linguistics.
This conception originated in 1963-1964, mainly as a reaction to the existing
form of transformational description.  It has not yet been possible to take the
more recent impulses into account to an extent that would be adequate to their
scope and theoretical significance.  Only some aspects of these impulses are
commented on in the relevant parts of the present book.  We do not present a
complete characterization of a system that could be regarded as a counterpart
to the new version of transformational grammar.  We have simply tried
to formulate a conception that can serve as a starting point for the
development of a new alternative.
