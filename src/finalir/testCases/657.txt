Standards For Writing Abstracts

Weil, Ben H.

   An abstract, as defined here, is an abbreviated, accurate representation
of a document.. The following recommendations are made for the guidance of
authors and editors, so that abstracts in primary documents may be both
helpful to their readers and reproducible with little or no change in
secondary publications and services..
   Prepare an abstract for every formal item in journals and proceedings,
and for each separately published report, pamphlet, thesis, monograph, 
and patent.. Place the abstract as early as possible in the document..
Make the abstract as informative as the document will permit, so that
readers may decide whether they need to read the entire document.. State the
purpose, methods results, and conclusions presented in the document, either
in that order or with initial emphasis on findings..
   Make each abstract self-contained but concise; retain the basic information
and tone of the original document..  Keep abstracts of most papers to 
fewer than 250 words, abstracts of reports and theses to fewer than 500 words
(preferably on one page), and abstracts of short communications to fewer
than 100 words.. Write most abstracts in a single paragraph.. Normally
employ complete, connected sentences; active verbs; ad the third person..
Employ standard nomenclature, or define unfamiliar terms, abbreviations, and
symbols the first time they occur in the abstract..
