a simple extension of southwell's method for determining the elastic
general instability pressure of ring-stiffened cylinders subject
to external hydrostatic pressure .
a simple extension of southwell's method is presented whereby the
elastic general instability pressure of ring-stiffened cylindrical
shells subject to external hydrostatic pressure may be determined .  an
actual application of the method is illustrated in the paper and the
results of several other examples are summarized .
