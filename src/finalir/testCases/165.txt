The Theoretical Foundation of the IDC-system:  Six Postulates for Information Retrieval

Fugmann, Robert

  Successful delegated searching for publications relevant to the topic of
an inquirer obeys rules whose relations to thermodynamics are unmistakable.
By the continuous growth of a documentation system in the physical and
conceptual respect, steadily increasing demands are made on the degree of order
which prevails in the system or can be established at the specific request of
an inquirer.  If the order in a system cannot keep pace with the increasing
requirements, its working capability will continuously decrease, because
the searcher is becoming more and more overburdened in relation to his
available search time, search patience, and search memory.  The degree of
order attainable in a growing literature collection can be estimated on the
basis of six postulates.  The better the requirements imposed by these
postulates are approximated in a practical documentation system, the higher
are its working capability and life expectancy, but the expenditure to be
made on the literature analyses must also inevitably be higher.
  The establishment of these postulates originated from practical experience
with the IDC-system and its precursors.  These postulates form the basis
of this system and of its further development.
