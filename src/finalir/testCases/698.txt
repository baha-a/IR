Encoding and Decoding WLN

Miller, George A.

   This paper deals with the encoding and decoding of a Wiswesser Line Notation
(WLN).. This problem so far has been addressed only from the point of human..
This paper discusses the encoding and decoding with exactness suitable for a
computer, and is an outgrowth of a computer program now in operation at NIH 
which automatically encodes and decodes WLN..
