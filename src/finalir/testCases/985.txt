The Bibliographer in the Academic Library

Haro, Robert P.

   Academic libraries, in their quest to secure and make available library
materials necessary to support instructional and research programs, are finding
it necessary to rely upon librarians functioning as book selectors.. The term
bibliographer (frequently applied to these selectors) is gradually taken on
new meaning in library service.. The role of the bibliographer is changing to
include (besides book selection) new duties and responsibilities such as
advanced reference, research work, instruction, and liaison duties between 
teaching departments and the library.. In addition, academic library 
organization is gradually being affected by the increasing use of 
bibliographers..
