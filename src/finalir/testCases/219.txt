Timour, John A.

   The results of a survey and weighted summary of all major suggested journal
subscription lists for hospital libraries are described.. A total of ninety-one
titles  taken from 225 titles examined is listed under thirty-three subject
headings.. Contrasts are made for the titles and subject headings employed by 
others, and the potential of Stearns' "core collection" concept for small
medical libraries is dealt with in detail..
