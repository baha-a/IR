The Effect of Growth on the Obsolescence of Semiconductor Physics Literature

Oliver, Merrill R.

   Semiconductor physics literature is studied in order to investigate recent
hypotheses relating obsolescence to the growth in periodical literature and the
growth in the number of contributing scientists.. The results indicate that
obsolescence remains constant and that the two growth rates are, within
experimental error, of equal magnitude for this subject over a five-year 
period.. These results are seen to be inconsistent with the assumption that an
exponentially-growing literature possesses a constant utility..
