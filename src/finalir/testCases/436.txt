Industrial Research and Technological Innovation an Econometric Analysis

Mansfield, E.

   After many years of neglect, technological change is receiving the attention
from economists that it deserves, the 1960's being a time of a enormous 
interest in this area in academic, government, and business circles.. Central 
to the economics of technological change is the manner in which new processes
and products are conceived, developed, commercialized, and accepted.. To help
promote a better understanding of this process, I have been engaged for a 
number of years in a series of related econometric studies of industrial 
research and technological innovation.. The purpose of this book is to bring
together the results of these studies..
