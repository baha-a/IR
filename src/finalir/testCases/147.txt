Research on Users' Needs: Where is it Getting Us?

Hanson, C.W.

  Since Bernal made his pilot survey of the use of scientific literature
for the 1948 Royal Society Scientific Information Conference, at least
three dozen other investigations have been reported of the needs of
scientists and engineers for information, of their information gathering
habits, and the use to which they put information.
  Some of these have been concerned with the people in individual
organizations, but have implications elsewhere.  Others, including
Aslib's own investigations, have had wider aims.  Some have been
based upon observations and records of what the scientists and
engineers themselves did or said, and some upon records of the demands
they made upon libraries.  There have been both surveys of opinions,
and collections of facts.
