heat transfer in turbulent shear flow .
  the problems of heat transfer in turbulent shear flow along a
smooth wall are discussed from the point of view of von karman's
well-known 1939 paper on the analogy between fluid friction and
heat transfer .  methods for extending the analysis to higher
prandtl numbers are suggested .
