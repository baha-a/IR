Inequality; a reassessment of the effect of family and schooling in America

Jenchs, C.

  This book summarizes the results of three years of research at the
Center for Educational Policy Research.  The eight coauthors were all
Research Associates at the Center, and our work there was a collaborative
effort.  We plagiarized both ideas and data from one another.  Most of
us also spent a good deal of time criticizing one another's work.  While
each of us took primary responsibility for certain lines of inquiry, and
this responsibility is recorded in appropriate footnotes, we see our
research as an integrated effort which should bear all our names.
