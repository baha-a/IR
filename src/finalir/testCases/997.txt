   The Ohio College Library Center is a regional library network.. Its on-line 
shared cataloging system has been operational since 18 October 1971,and utilizes
cathode ray tube terminals located in the center's fifty-three member 
libraries.. These terminals are connected to the Sigma 5 computer in Columbus by
a multiple line, multiple party synchronous transmission telephone network.. 
Between January and June 1972 the system operated at an annual rate of 500,000 
works cataloged and over 3,400,000 catalog cards produced .. These cards are
individualized to fit the requirements of each member and are produced in packs
designated for particular catalogs..
