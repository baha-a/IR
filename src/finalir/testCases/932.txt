buckling of circular cones under axial compression .
presented are the results of an experimental
investigation to determine the buckling
strength of right circular cones under axial
compression .  correlation of these data is
made with existing theory and with previously
published experimental data on circular
cylinders,. thus a recommended procedure
for predicting the buckling load of right
circular cones under the foregoing loading
condition is presented .
