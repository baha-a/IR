on the flutter of panels at high mach numbers .
there have recently arisen some questions as to the
possibility of panel flutter at high dynamic pressures and
mach numbers .  in addition, some doubts have been raised
about the convergence of the galerkin method when applied to
such problems .  this note is intended to shed light on these
matters .
