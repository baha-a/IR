temperature profiles inafinite solid with moving boundary .
a numerical solution is presented to the transient heat conduction
equation for a cylinder of finite thickness with one moving boundary .
the implicit method of solution is developed with conductivity as an
arbitrary function of temperature . application is made to a sample case
 of re-entry heating encountered by aerodynamic bodies, with erosion by
sublimation and combustion occurring at the body surface .
