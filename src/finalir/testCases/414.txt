The History of Libraries in the Western World

Johnson, E.D.

    The present work is an attempt to trace the history of libraries
in the western world:  to indicate how libraries developed and how
they influenced the social and cultural history of our civilization.
The book is intended for the student of library science or of cultural
history and for the general reader interested in the development of western
civilization.  Much has been omitted concerning libraries and librarians
that could have been included; conversely, some facts could have been
omitted without seriously detracting from the story as a whole but have
been included to illustrate how library history developed; they point out
the high spots and indicate trends.
