Information Analysis and Retrieval

Kent, A.

    Therefore the purpose of this book remains the same as that of Textbook on
Mechanized Information Retrieval - to teach basics to those who have had no
previous exposure either to the field or to computers, or both.  Therefore,
the action is slowed to the point where the logical principles of information
retrieval systems are laid bare.  Other books have been published that emphasize
computer programming - this one does not.
