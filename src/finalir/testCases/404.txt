A Guide to the Library of Congress Classification

Immroth, J.P.

  This guide is an introduction to the Library of Congress Classification; as
such, it does not include instructions for every subclass or table, but attempts
to provide the reader with an understanding of the characteristics of the
classification, the arrangement within the classes, the format of the schedules
and tables, and special problems of use and notation.  The reader should trace
the analysis of each example of classing through the pages from the L.C. 
schedule provided in the guide.  It is important to remind the reader that a
thorough study of each class schedule in addition to the recommended readings
is essential.  The author realizes that many imperfections may be present in
this guide and will appreciate suggestions for changes from readers.
