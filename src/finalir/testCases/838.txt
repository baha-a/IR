Prospects for a New General Classification

Austin, Derec

   In traditional classification schemes, the universe of knowledge is broken down
into self-contained disciplines which are further analysed to the point at which
a particular concept is decated.. This leads to problems of:
   (a) currency: keeping the scheme in line with new discoveries..
   (b) hospitality: allowing room for insertion of new subjects..
   (c) cross-classification: a concept may be considered in such a way that it 
       fits as logically into one discipline as another..
   Machine retrieval is also hampered by the fact that any individual concept is
notated differently, depending on where in the scheme it appears..
   The approach now considered is from an organized universe of concepts, every 
concept being set down only once in an appropriate vocabulary, where it acquires
the notation which identifies it wherever it is used.. It has been found that
all the concepts present in any compound subject can be handled as though they
belong to one of two basic concept types, using either Entitles or Attributes..
In classing, these concepts are identified, and notation is selected from
appropriate schedules.. Subjects are then built according to formal rules, the
final class number incorporating operators which convey the fundamental 
relationships between concepts..
   Fron this viewpoint, the Rules and Operators of the proposed system can be 
seen as the grammar of an IR language, and the schedules of Entitles and 
Attributes as its vocabulary..
