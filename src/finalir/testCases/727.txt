Ware, Glenn O.Park, Margaret K.

   Two statistical models for estimating search time have been developed for 
the CA Condensates data base using the University of Georgia Text Search
System.. Graphs showing the effect of data base size and number of search terms 
on search time are presented.. Comparative timings between the Chemical
Abstracts Service search program and the University of Georgia search program
are made for the CA Condensates data base..
