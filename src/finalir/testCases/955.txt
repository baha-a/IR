Interrelations among Special Librarys

Budington, W.S.

  The present paper will first deal with some of the objectives, etiology, and
requirements of the library network as it overtakes and embraces co-operation.
Next, in this context of network development, a number of activities
involving special libraries will be reviewed by way of illustration and 
example.  The greatest proportion of special library interrelationships are,
on the surface at least, random and  informal.  We shall therefore concentrate
on such arrangements as have about them some measure of structure and intent.
Finally, we will deduce from these examples the performance and promise
which special libraries may offer to a total library network or information 
system.
