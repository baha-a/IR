Citation Analyses as Indicators of the Use of Serials: A Comparison of Ranked Title Lists Produced by Citation Counting and from Use Data

Scales, Pauline A.

   Lists of journals ranked according to number of citations received are 
frequently used as indicators of usefulness, but little research has been 
carried out to test the validity of this hypothesis.. On comparing lists of 
titles of journals ranked by citation counting with lists of the same journals, 
ranked according to frequency of use (using data from a survey at the National 
Lending Library), it was found that the rank order correlation between the two 
was low.. This suggestions that ranked lists produced by analyses of citations 
do not constitute valid guides for journal selection by libraries..
