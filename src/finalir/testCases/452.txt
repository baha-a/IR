   The U.S. National Library of Medicine (NLM) initiated its computer-based

Currently, The NLM has eight international MEDLARS quid-pro-quo arrangements 
with the United Kingdom, Sweden, France, West Germany, Japan, Australia, Canada
and the World Health Organization.. The policy aspects of the arrangements are
discussed as well as the organizational and operational characteristics of 
these non-U.S. MEDLARS Centers..
