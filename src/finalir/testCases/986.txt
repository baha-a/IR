MEDLARS:  A Summary Review and Evaluation of Three Reports

Stevens, N.D.

  The MEDLARS (Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System)
system at the National Library of Medicine (NLM) has over
the past few years been one of the most significant and one of the most
publicized automated bibliographic information retrieval systems.  Over
two hundred articles on it have appeared in American newspapers and 
popular magazines, in specialized medical journals throughout the world,
and in a variety of library journals.  The publicity that has attended this
project has, in a way, been unfortunate, for it has presented an
exaggerated picture of the system and its accomplishments which has only
made the sceptics more skeptical; and it has obscured in part the
examination of MEDLARS' real accomplishments.  There has to date been very
little careful outside analysis and evaluation of MEDLARS.  Over 50
percent of all the articles listed in the bibliography in Austin's report,
and virtually all the substantive ones, represent the work of persons
closely connected with NLM or the development of the MEDLARS
system.  Their judgement on the effectiveness of the system and its overall
value cannot help but be colored by this connection.
