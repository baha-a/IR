Issues in Semantics

Lakhuti, D.G.

   The present collection of articles discusses three basic problems:  the
typological classification of information retrieval languages, the formal 
method of lexical semantic research, and textual semantics. Problems 
connected with lexical word meaning, the building up of semantic fields using 
computers, and automatic indexing are considered.
