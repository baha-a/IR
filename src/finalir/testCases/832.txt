The Status of 'Practicum' in Graduate Library Schools

Grotzinger, L.

  The early schools were dedicated to practical work as a
necessary component of every program; this fact is
heavily documented in numerous commentaries on the time.
As this century progressed, however, this pioneer 
preoccupation came under strong criticism and by the 
1930's and in more recent decades, an equally strong
documentation attacks the earlier curricula.  Now, in
the 1970's amid the many questions raised about the
relevance of contemporary library education, there
appears to be a revival in the use of field experiences.
