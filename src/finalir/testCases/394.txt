A Feasibility Study of Centralized and Regionalized Inter-LibraryLoan Centers

Stevens, R.E.

  The two major problems of the present system are (1) the unequal
distribution of lending, with a few of the largest libraries handling
a large proportion of the requests, and (2) the difficulty of filling
requests which are incomplete, incorrect, or inadequately checked.
  Solutions proposed for these two problems have been (1)
compensation to the largest libraries for each transaction, and (2)
better bibliographic checking of requests before they are forwarded to
the lending library.
