Library and Information Science Abstracts: The First Two Years

Gilcrist, A.Presanis, A.

  With the thirteenth issue affected by the recent postal strike, now seems
an opportune moment to take a look at the performance of LISA in its first two
years.  This bi-monthly abstracts service succeeded the former Library Science
Abstracts in 1969 as a joint venture between the Library Association and Aslib.
A recount of its birth and a brief report on early progress both appeared in
1969.
