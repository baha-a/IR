  The Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) Chemical Registry System is a computer-
based system that uniquely identifies chemical substances on the basis of
composition and structure.  Since initial operation in 1964 as a stand-alone
input, storage, and retrieval system for structural representations of organic
chemical compounds, the scope of the CAS Registry System has steadily increased
to include all types of chemical substances and the entire system has been
integrated into CAS indexing operations.  The third refinement of this system,
Registry III, which has been in operation for over a year, involves major
changes in Registry recods but no change in the basic algorithmic techniques
for registering chemical substances.  The previous format for listing atoms 
and bonds has been modified so that each ring system is now separately 
identified, and this ring-system identifier is used in the record for each
substance that contains that ring.  These modifications support CAS nomenclature
derivation and also a computer-based structure output system.  The general
design of Registry III, which involves a structure record of cyclic and acyclic
segments, is presented.
