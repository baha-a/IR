A Comprehensive Study Based on Physics Abstracts

Keeman, S.

  The Documentation Research Project of the American Institute has been
engaged for some years in an effort to improve the various systems available
for the publication and dissemination of physics literature.  Numerous
aspects of the problem have been studied and much information has been
obtained from the projects listed in the bibliography which appears on
the inside cover of this Report.  Studies which resulted in the determination
of the indexing requirements of research physicists, new methods for the
content analysis and indexing of physics research papers, and better
production methods for journal indexes have formed the backbone of the work
which has as its ultimate objective the creation of a reference retrieval system 
which is adequate for the physicists who will use it.
