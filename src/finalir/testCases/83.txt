The Cost Analysis of Document Surrogation:  A Literature Review

Landau, Herbert B.

   A state-of-the art literature review on the cost of classification, 
cataloging, indexing, and abstracting has been included.. It was found that
while some data on specific costs are available, the literature is generally
found lacking from the point of view of accuracy, completeness, consistency,
and availability..
