On-Line  Serials Control System in a Large Biomedical Library;1) Description of the System

Fayollat, James

   An on-line serials control system with particular emphasis on storage and
maintenance concepts is described.. The system, operational since January,
1971, has evolved from a former batch card system and remains completely
compatible with it.. The system allows real-time display and updating of
all elements of the file.. Consequently all check-in, bindery, and claims
operations, as well as new entries and data field changes are accomplished
on a real-time basis.. All programs are in PL/1.. Required equipment is an
IBM time-shared facility with 100 K memory available for the applications
programs, and IBM 2260 display units..
   This article is the first of three.. The second is concerned with an
analysis of inverted file retrieval features and the third compares the
operation of the on-line with the batch system, comparable manual operations,
and discusses costs..
