Education and Training for Scientific and TechnologicalLibrary and Information Work

Schur, M.

  The exponential growth of the literature of science and technology is a
phenomenon which scientists have been living with for the past 300 years.
It is in the nature of such growth that its effect is recognized only slowly,
but when a critical point is reached its consequences can be overwhelming.
In science information this point has now been reached.  To take but one 
field, chemistry, it took well over two centuries for the first million papers
to be published, and over 30 years, from 1907 to 1938, for the first million
to be abstracted in Chemical Abstracts.  We are now at the stage where one
million papers have been abstracted in a five-year period - 1962-1967 - and
before 1975 the point will have been reached where one million papers, equal
to the output of the whole pre-war generation of chemists, will be
published and abstracted in a single year. The first scientific serial began
publication in 1665.  Some 290 years later, in 1956, the Science Museum
Library was receiving 9,000 current scientific serials.  Within only a
further 11 years the National Lending Library for Science and Technology
(N.L.L.) was receiving over three times this number.  The growth in the use
of scientific literature is no less spectacular.  Thus, for example, in 1930
the number of loans by the Science Museum Library was 10,000.  In 1967 the
N.L.L., which had taken over the national lending function of the Science
Museum Library, lent well over half-a-million items, a total exceeding that of
all the loans by the Science Museum Library between 1929 and 1947 (a period
which itself saw the discovery of nuclear fission and its application for
peaceful uses, enormous progress in antibiotics, developments in synthetic
materials and great advances in all branches of science and technology).
There are some signs that the rate of increase implied in these examples
may not be maintained, but any flattening-out that may develop will be at
a very high level indeed.
