The Large Data Base File Structure Dilemma

Lefkovitz, D.

  This paper first presents a brief tutorial on the principal random file
organization methods for handling two major applications - Transaction
oriented systems and Information storage and retrieval systems.  It then
addresses a particular large data base dilemma, not satisfactorily
resolved by any of these methods, and which is currently under active
investigation.  Two approaches to a solution are described.  One is
called the hybrid inverted list; the other is based upon an old technique
called super-imposed coding.  The former has been implemented and has 
recently been installed in an operational system.  Some statistics related
to file characteristics in this application are provided, but operational
cost and performance statistics are not yet available.
