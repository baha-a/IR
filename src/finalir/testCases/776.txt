Tests on Abstracts Journals:  Coverage Overlap and Indexing

Martyn, J.

   In a previous paper (J. Doc. 20 (4) 1964, 212-35) a series of tests on
the coverage, overlap, and indexing of abstracts journals were described.
Briefly, these were carried out by selecting recent, comprehensive
bibliographies on specific subjects, searching the appropriate abstracts
journals via the author indexes to determine the number of references given
in the bibliography that were abstracted, then consulting the subject
indexes to try to locate those references which are known to have been 
abstracted.  A further eight bibliographies have been studied, and the
results are reported here.
   Our results are presented below in the following form:
1. Title of bibliography, source, content (number of journal references,
   reports, etc.).
2. Abstracts journals consulted.
3. Coverage and multiple coverage.  This is a bar-chart showing number of
   references not abstracted, those covered once, twice, and so on.
4. Coverage by each abstracts journal, given as a bar-chart, the last column
   showing coverage by all services combined.  (Where bar-charts are given
   they show coverages as percentages of the whole bibliography, actual
   numbers of references being shown beneath the appropriate columns.
5. Taking each abstracts journal separately, we show the headings under
   which references were found in the subject index.  Some references we
   were unable to locate, so there is often an apparent discrepancy with the
   figures given in 4.
