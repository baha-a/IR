Brookes, B. C.

   Objective comparisons of the effectiveness of IR techniques are needed for
development of IR systems.. The measures proposed by Swets, which offer 
important advantages, are analyzed and critically discussed.. Modifications of 
the Swets measures, designed to increase their generality and to facilitate 
their interpretation in terms of system variables, are proposed..
