Optimum Procedures for Economic Information Retrieval

   Computer searches on Chemical Titles tapes for current awareness at the 
University of Alberta since May, 1968, have provided sufficient data to allow 
formulation of a cost function based on the number of titles searched, the 
length of questions, the extent to which questions may be batched, and certain 
details regarding the allowed forms of question.. With different choice of 
parameters the cost function could be adapted to apply to searches of other data 
bases..
   An attempt to make retrospective searching economically feasible has led to
formulation of different search techniques.. It is suggested that the search 
procedure should be designed to minimize computation time at the expense of 
convenience in the form of output, but that facilities should be included so 
that the user who is willing to play the additional cost may receive output in 
a more convenient form..
   In recognition of the fact that the form of search question should be 
dependent on the vocabulary of the data base, a program has been developed to 
modify a question so that it is optimal for searches on the given data base..
