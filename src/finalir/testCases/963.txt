a variational principle for convection of heat .
authors extend variational principle of biot to various cases of heat
transfer due to forced convection . numerical results are given for
one-dimensional problems of fluid flowing between parallel walls with
uniform or parabolic velocity profiles . agreement with exact solutions
is excellent .
