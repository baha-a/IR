New Methods in Automatic Extracting

Edmundson, H.P.

  This paper describes new methods of automatically extracting documents for
screening purposes, i.e. the computer selection of sentences having the
greatest possible potential for conveying to the reader the substance of
the document.  While previous work has focused on one component of sentence
significance, namely, the presence of high-frequency content words (key words),
the methods described here also treat three additional components: pragmatic
words (cue words); title and heading words; and structural indicators (sentence
location).
  The research has resulted in an operating system and a research methodology.
The extracting system is parameterized to control and vary the influence of
the above four components.  The research methodology includes procedures for
the compilation of the required dictionaries, the setting of the control
parameters, and the comparative evaluation of the automatic extracts with
manually produced extracts.  The results indicate that the three newly proposed
components dominate the frequency component in the production of better 
extracts.
  KEY WORDS AND PHRASES:  automatic extracting, automatic abstracting, sentence 
selection, document screening, sentence significance, relevance, content words,
key words, pragmatic words, cue words, title words, sentence location, research
methodology, parameterization, comparative evaluation.
