The View from the Tower of Babel

Gore, D.

     A funny thing happened on the way
to the biggest building boom in library
history.  Book collections grew faster
than the new space to hold them, so when
the boom was over the aggregate space
problem of academic libraries was a little
worse than it was at the beginning.
     During the roughly eight-year span
of the rise and fall of the boom, some 570
new or expanded library buildings sprang
up on the campuses of four-year and
graduate institutions around the nation.
