Henderson, J.W.

    The major conclusions and recommendations of the study which follows are:
  That the catalogs of The Research Libraries of the New York Public Library be
divided chronologically at the earliest possible date;
  That the present (or retrospective) Public Catalog be reproduced 
photographically in book form;
  That the future (or prospective) catalogs be produced in a combination of 
card and book form from a store of machine-readable data;
  That a Central Serial Record be created to contain acquisition information, 
cataloging and holdings data, and bindery records for all serial publications 
in The Research Libraries.
