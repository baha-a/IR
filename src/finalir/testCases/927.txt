Personal Relations Between Librarians and Readers

Green, S.S.

  When scholars and persons of high social position come to a library,
they have confidence enough, in regard to the cordiality of their reception, 
to make known their wishes without timidity or reserve.
  Modest men in the humbler walks of life, and well-trained boys and girls, 
need encouragement before they become ready to say freely what they want.
  A hearty reception by a sympathizing friend, and the recognition of some one 
at hand who will listen to inquiries, even although he may consider them 
unimportant,  make it easy for such persons to ask questions, and put them at 
once on a  home footing.
