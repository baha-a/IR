Procedures for Converting Systematic Names of OrganicCompounds into Atom-Bond Connection Tables

  Simultaneously with its development of a computer-based Chemical Compound
Registry System, Chemical Abstracts Service is devising procedures for 
automatically converting systematic names of organic compounds into atom-
bound connection tables which can be manipulated by computer.  A study of
systematic Chemical Abstracts (CA) index names has resulted in a dictionary
of word roots used in the names and in step-by-step procedures for converting 
names to connection tables.  Statistical studies of nomenclature in CA indexes
show that these procedures are applicable not only to current nomenclature,
but also generally to names in past indexes.  Procedures have been written
which are applicable to the majority of names of carbon compounds, and the
preparation of computer programs is now under way.
