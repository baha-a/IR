A Regional Network - Ohio college Library Center

Kilgour, F.G.

  The Ohio College Library Center is developing
a computerized, user-oriented, library system
that will improve efficiency of library use and
operations; that will increase availability of
library resources within a region; and that will facilitate
evolution of new and easier accesses to information in
libraries.  The center does not conceive of its task as being
merely the mechanization of library procedures of the past.
  For the immediate future, the principal academic objective
of the center is to increase the availability of library
resources for use in educational and research programs in
colleges and universities throughout Ohio.  A more distant
objective is to enable libraries to participate actively in the
programs of instruction and research in their institutions.
The passive service functions that libraries have developed
during the past century are proving inadequate to meet the
present demands made of libraries, and will be increasingly
inadequate in the future.
  The per-student costs of libraries are rising somewhat
more than twice as rapidly as unit-cost rises in the general
economy.  Therefore, the principal economic goal of the
Ohio College Library Center is to decelerate the rate of rise
of per-student costs, so that the rate of increase will
approximate that of the economy as a whole.
