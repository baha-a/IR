Work Study in Libraries

Gilchrist, Alan

   A brief review of the principal work study techniques is given.. It is
suggested that these techniques are applicable to libraries and librarians and
will become increasingly useful as the problems of increased work loads become 
more severe.. Data concerning standard times and performances would be useful
for system design and planning, providing such data is put in its proper 
context and particularly if it is used to improve effectiveness as well as
efficiency..
