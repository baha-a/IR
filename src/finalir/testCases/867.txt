An Algorithm for Compaction of Alphanumeric Data

Schieber, William D.Thomas, George W.

   Description of a technique for compressing data to be placed in computer
auxiliary storage.. The technique operates on the principle of taking two
alphabetic characters frequently used in combination and replacing them with
one unused special character code.. Such one-for-two replacement has enabled
the ILO to achieve a rate of compression of 43.5% on a data base of 
approximately 40,000 bibliographic records..
