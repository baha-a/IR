The Automatic Encoding of Chemical Structures

Feldman, A.Holland, D.B.Jacobus, D.P.

  Many methods for the coding of chemical structures 
have been described in the literature.	Some methods code
the compound only partially; typical of these are the
methods using descriptor codes.  Other methods, among
which the so-called ciphers are prominent, code
compounds exhaustively.  All these methods require
cerebral effort; that is, a chemist is needed who must 
have learned the rules of the code, and who must known how
to dismember correctly each structure to be coded.  A
disadvantage of code designations of structures is, furthermore,
that they are not generally understood by chemists.  No
advantages accrue to the chemist from knowing how to
generate and how to interpret a chemical code.	Codes are
needed only for the mechanical manipulation of chemical
structures.  Clearly then, if the coding of chemical compounds
could be accomplished automatically this automatic conversion would
relieve the chemist of considerable burden.
