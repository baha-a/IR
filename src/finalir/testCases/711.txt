Development and Production of Chemical Titles, a Current Awareness IndexPublication Prepared with the Aid of a Computer

Freeman, R.R.Dysn, G.M.

  The introduction of Chemical titles in 1961 marked the
first publication produced almost entirely by computers
and other data-processing equipment.  The success of this
innovation has generated many requests for more information
about it.  With this in mind, we hope to encourage
other organizations to make use of this technique for
dissemination of information by presenting here a history
of Chemical titles' development coupled with a description
of its production.
