Random Sampling: a Tool for Library Research

Drott, M. Carl

   Questions about the accuracy of library records, the behavior or attitudes
of patrons, or the conditions of the books in the collection can often be 
answered by a random sampling study.. Use of this time and money saving 
technique requires no special mathematical ability or statistical background..
The concept of accuracy is discussed and a table is provided to simplify the
determination of an appropriate sample size.. A method of selecting a sample 
using random numbers is shown.. Three examples illustrate the application of 
the technique to library problems..
