   A small-scale, computer-based SDI system in plasma physics and the related 
subjects is described briefly.. The system serves about 100 research scientists 
and engineers and uses title input only in order to minimize input costs.. The
implications of this approach and its effect upon the system parameters is
discussed.. Some comparison of the costs of the computer-based system with 
those of a manual system is made..
   Further experiments are described in which the service is expanded to 
external users on a world-wide basis, the aim being to compare, under controlled
conditions, the parameters of the small-scale internal service with those of an 
external service on a wide scale..
   The paper concludes with some observations on the future development and 
organization of computer-assisted services, their possibilities and the main 
problems which are likely to arise..
