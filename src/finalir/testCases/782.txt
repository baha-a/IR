Statistics of Scientific and Technical Articles

Vickery, B.C.

  A new estimate of the number of currently published scientific and
technical periodicals has been put forward by K.P. Barr of the National
Lending Library.  It may be of interest to supplement this with some figures
on the number and distribution of articles within these periodicals.  These
figures are derived from a survey undertaken at the NLL early in 1964.
