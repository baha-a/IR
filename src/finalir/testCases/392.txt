Faculty Status for Librarians

Massman, V.F.

  The purpose of this study is:  (1) to
review the history of the struggle for faculty status for
librarians and some of the arguments advanced in support of
that objective; and (2) to gather information on the 
similarities and differences between librarians and faculty 
members in the broad areas of preparation, contributions,
and rewards.  With detailed information on such matters
as education, salaries, professional experience, tenure, sabbaticals,
participation in academic government, and scholarly activity
of librarians and faculty members, one should be able to
judge whether librarians receive unfair or unequal treatment.
