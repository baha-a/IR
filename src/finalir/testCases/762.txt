Opening the Black Box of 'Relevance'

Cuarda, Carlos A.Katter, Robert V.

   The purpose of this project was to identify variables thought to affect 
relevance judgements and conduct a series of laboratory studies to determine
the effects of these variables on relevance judgements.. This paper discusses
the variable of 'implicit use orientations' - the particular attitude taken by
a subject (judge) about the intended use of a document.. One hundred and forty
judges rated each of nine abstracts for relevance to several short information 
requirement statements.. The some judges then repeated the ratings, each 
adopting (assuming) one of the fourteen use orientations described to them.. It
was found that the particular use orientation assumed by the judge has a marked 
effect on relevance judgements.. It was also found that implicit use 
orientations can be analysed in terms of their underlying structure and that
their study offers the possibility of discovering the conditions under which
one person can accurately simulate and use the implicit use orientations of 
another..
   Relevance judgements have been used as a basis of measures designed to
evaluate the effectiveness of information retrieval system.. This judgements
have usually been accepted at face value and have not been subjected to 
critical scrutiny.. There is reason to believe, however, that as ordinarily
obtained, they may be unreliable and sensitive to a number of conditions of
measurement that have not been carefully controlled in previous evaluation
studies..
