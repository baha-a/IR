The Bradford Distribution

Leimkuhler, Ferdinand F.

   The distribution of references in a collection of pertinent source documents
can be described and predicted by the relation F(x) = ln(1 + bx)/ln(1 + b) where
the parameter b is related to the subject field and the completeness of the
collection.. The model is used to predict the reference yield of abstracting
journals in a search for thermophysical property data.. It is used also to 
explain differences among various literature studies of the past in terms of
differences in subject and comprehensiveness of search.. The model is derived 
from S.C. Bradford's 'law of scattering' and is called the Bradford 
Distribution..
