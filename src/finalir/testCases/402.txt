The government of the American Public Library

Joeckel, C.B.

  The major purpose of this study is to describe, analyze,
and evaluate the position of the public library in the structure
of government in the United States.  The use of the word
"government" in the title, therefore, is deliberate.  We are
here concerned with the legal forms and types of governmental
organization of the public library and with its relation to
the city or other political unit to which it is attached or
which it serves.
