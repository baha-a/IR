Machine_Aided Indexing of Technical Literature

Klingbiel, Paul H.

   To index successfully in the Defense Documentation Center's environment, an
automated system must chose single words or phrases (dependent upon context)
rapidly and economically.. The automation of DDC's indexing has been 
machine-aided from its inception.. A machine-aided indexing (MAI) system is 
described that indexes one million words of text per hour of CPU time.. 
Grammatical errors do not exceed five per cent of the output, so human 
screening is satisfactorily low.. The system could potentially scale up to an
operational size of 10 million words of text per year - the equivalent of a
dozen bibles or a third of the Encyclopedia Britannica.. In a batch mode, the
programs to accomplish this indexing would require no more than fifteen minutes
of CPU time per week..
