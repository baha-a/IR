A Cooperative Serial Acquisition Program: Thoughts on a Response toMounting Fiscal Pressures

Jones, C. Lee

   A regionally cooperative method of distributing responsibility for every
serial title in a region is outlined.. The system assures the equitable
distribution of the number of titles for which each library is committed..
Later refinements suggest an equalization of cost commitments on the basis of
fiscal resources available for serial purchases.. It is pointed out that fiscal
realities will force some sort of serial acquisition cooperation for all viable
medical libraries..
