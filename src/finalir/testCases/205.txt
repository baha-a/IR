The Circulation Analysis of Serial Use:  Numbers Game or Key to Service?

Raisig, Miles L.

   The conventionally erected and reported circulation analysis of serial use
in the individual and the feeder library is found to be statistically invalid
and misleading, since it measures neither the intellectual use of the serial's
contents nor the physical handlings or serial units, and is nonrepresentative
of the in-depth library use of serials.. It fails utterly to report or even to
suggest the relation of intralibrary and interlibrary serial resources.. The
actual mechanics of the serial use analysis, and the active variables in the
library situation which affect serial use, are demonstrated in a simulated
analysis and are explained at length.. A positive design is offered for the
objective gathering and reporting of data on the local intellectual use and
physical handling of serials and the relating of resources.. Data gathering in
the feeder library, and implications for the extension of the feeder library's
resources, are discussed..
