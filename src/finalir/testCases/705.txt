  Methods for retrieval of information on chemical compounds utilizing several
computer data bases have been compared to determine scope of data base coverage.
Queries for a single chemical, N-ethyl-@-methyl-m-trifluoromethylphenethylamine
(fenfluramine) and generic chemicals (2-pyrrolidinones) were submitted to the
services for searching through the recent literature.  Data bases employed
included MEDLARS, Excerpta Medica, CA Condensates, CBAC, Ringdoc, Current
Abstracts in Chemistry and Automatic New Structure Alert (ANSA).  Preparation
of search questions is outlined and comparative results are reported indicating
the yield from each data base.
