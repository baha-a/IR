Hills, P. J.

   The purpose of a university education is defined here as the need to guide
the student towards becoming a self-directing individual.. This paper examines
this purpose in terms of student needs and the awareness of both academic and
library staff.. Psychological principles of learning as applied to this purpose
are considered together with the use of audio-visual methods.. The paper ends
with a consideration of some present practical constraints and the possibilities
for future action..
