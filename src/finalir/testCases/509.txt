The Use of Hierarchic Clustering in Information Retrieval

Jardine, N.Van Rijsbergen, C. J.

   We introduce information retrieval strategies which are based on automatic
hierarchic clustering of documents.. We discuss the evaluation of retrieval
strategies and show, using a subset of the Cranfield Aeronautics document 
collection, that cluster-based retrieval strategies can be devised which are as 
effective as linear associative retrieval strategies and much more efficient..
Finally, we outline how cluster-based retrieval may be extended to large growing
document collections and indicate some ways in which the effectiveness of
cluster-based retrieval strategies may be improved..
