a graphical approximation for temperatures and sublimation rates at
surfaces subjected to small net and large gross heat transfer rates .
considers a material, acted upon by heat of conduction, which changes
its state by sublimation at the heated surface . the derived method is
most suitable under conditions of severe heating such as space vehicle
re-entry .
