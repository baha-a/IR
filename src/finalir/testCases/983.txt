Criteria for Weeding of Collections

Cooper, Marianne

  Growing library collections have focused attention upon the need for selective
storage and weeding of the materials..Certain objective measures for determining
which items in a collection may be retired to storage are presented, and an 
example of the use of such measures at Columbia University is described.. It is 
concluded that the criteria for weeding and storage must be selected on the basis
of the goals of the institution in question and of the various patterns of use 
in different disciplines..
