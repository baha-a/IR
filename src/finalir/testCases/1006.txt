Library Service to the Disadvantaged

Brown, E.F.

        This volume is intended mainly as a source book for
project and program ideas for libraries now engaged in working
with the disadvantaged or planning to do so.  It is also
hoped that it will give an overview of the progress to date in
work with the disadvantaged by bringing together much of the
thinking and many of the ideas that have appeared in literature
or in conferences in the last few years.
