The Hidden Dimension

Hall, E.T.

  Generally speaking, there are two types of books of interest to the
serious reader today:  those that are content oriented, designed to
convey a particular body of knowledge, and those that deal with structure,
the way in which events are organized.  It is doubtful if an author 
has any control over which of these two types of books he writes,
though it is desirable that he be aware of the difference.  The same
applies to the reader whose satisfaction depends largely on his
unstated expectations.  In today's world, when all of us are overwhelmed
with data from many sources, it is easy to understand why people
are apt to feel that they are losing touch with developments even in
their own field.  One senses that there is also a growing awareness
of a loss of relatedness to the world at large.  This loss of relatedness
leads to an increased need for organizing frames of reference to aid
in intergrating the mass of rapidly changing information with which man
must cope. The Hidden Dimension attempts to provide just this.
