Terminology of Documentation

Wersig, G.

  The Terminology of Documentation is intended to help standardize basic
terminology in the rapidly developing field of documentation and thus to
foster international co-operation. It should also be useful as a reference 
work for organizations and individuals working in the fields of documentation,
libraries and information processing, to translators and to students in these
fields.
