Economics of Approval Plans

Spyersduran, P.

  Current budget strains on college and university libraries
require a stepped-up search for operating economies.  The
timely topic of economics of approval plans of the Third
International Conference on Approval and Gathering Plans
for Large and Medium Size Academic Libraries, held at the
Ramada Inn, West Palm Beach, Florida, February 17-19,
1971, has thus generated considerable interest.
  The papers published here constitute, by and large, original
research in this area.  The importance of these contributions
can hardly be overestimated, since they will no doubt mold
and influence collection development practices in the current
imprint area.
