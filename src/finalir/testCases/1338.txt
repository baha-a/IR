Notes and Letters

Moravcsik, M.J.Murugesan, P.

  We tried to concentrate on a few variables that might define the
nature of a citation, and to keep the rest of the variables constant.  In
particular, we used references in articles in a single journal, in a single
specialty of a single branch of science, and in a narrow time period.
Specifically, we investigated 30 articles dealing with theoretical high
energy physics, and published in Physical Review in the years 1968 to
1972 (inclusive).
