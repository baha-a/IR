general theory of airfoil sections having arbitrary
shape or pressure distribution .
  in this report a theory of thin airfoils of small camber is
developed which permits either the velocity distribution
corresponding to a given airfoil shape, or the airfoil shape
corresponding to a given velocity distribution to be calculated .  the
procedures to be employed in these calculations are outlined and
illustrated with suitable examples .
