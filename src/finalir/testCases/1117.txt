Mathematical Model of Classification Theory

Shreider, Y. A.

   Sets of objects possessing specified characteristics are studied.. The
similarity and equivalence relations between objects are established and
explored..
   A canonical system of characteristics is derived.. Similarity and commonness 
measures of the subsets of objects are investigated.. The implications of 
those notions for the problem of retrieval classification are pointed out..
