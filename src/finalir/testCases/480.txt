Some Structural Characteristics of Articulated Subject Indexes

Armitage, Janet E.Lynch, Michael F.

   An articulated subject index is one in which logical transformations of 
natural language phrases containing prepositions or connectives are employed to 
organize the noun phrases as subject headings, with subordinate displays of the 
remainder of the phrases.. The best-known example of the articulated subject 
index is that to Chemical Abstracts..
   It has been shown that a well-defined transformation links the entry, as it 
appears in the index, with the original phrase, in natural order, as it was 
first compiled by the indexer.. A reverse transformation can be used to 
generate potential index entries from indexing phrases containing one or more 
prepositions or connectives..
   A simple model has been devised for the generation of articulated subject 
index entries from natural language indexing phrases which exclude infinitives
or words acting as gerunds or participles.. A sorting algorithm has also been 
developed, the purpose of which is to select those entries which lead to 
greatest organization in the index display..
   Deviations from the model in manually-produced indexes are described.. The 
potential value of certain of these characteristics in information retrieval 
is examined..
