  This article focuses on differences between the physical and the social 
sciences regarding three major factors associated with the 
dissemination and assimilation of scientific information: (i) lags in the 
process of information flow; (ii) the organization and
effectiveness of informal networks; and (iii) the transfer of information from 
the informal to the formal domain.
