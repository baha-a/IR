The Philadelphia Project

Benford, J.Q.

  The objectives of the research were: 1) to determine actual requirements for
library resources by elementary and secondary grade students and to
evaluate existing library resources in terms both of student needs and national
standards, and 2) on the basis of this information to outline the respective
roles of the school libraries and the public libraries in providing needed
resources and in developing joint planning.
