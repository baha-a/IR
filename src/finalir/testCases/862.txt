An Algorithm for Variable-Length Proper-Name Compression

Dolby, James L.

   Viable on-line search systems require reasonable capabilities to
automatically detect (and hopefully correct) variations between request
format and stored format.. An important requirement is the solution of the
problem of matching proper names, not only because both input specifications
and storage specifications are subject ot error, but also because various 
transliteration schemes exist and can provide variant proper name forms in 
the same data base.. This paper reviews several proper name matching schemes
and provides an updated version of these schemes which tests out nicely on
the proper name equivalence classes of a suburban telephone book..  An
appendix lists the corpus of names used for algorithm test.
