boundary layers with suction and injection . a review
of published work on skin friction .
  available data on the effects of suction and injection on skin
friction are summarised and compared .
  it is shown that injection into a turbulent boundary layer can
produce a skin friction coefficient lower than the laminar value at the
same reynolds number on an impermeable plate .
