World Biomedical Journals, 1951-60:     A Study of the Relative Significance of 1,388 Titles Indexed in     Current List of Medical Literature

Raisig, L. Miles

   This study is an application of the relationship of serial articles
published to serial articles cited, developed in theory in the author's
"Statistical Bibliography in the Health Sciences" (BULLETIN 50: 450-461,
July 1962).. A ranked list of the indexes of significance of most of the
serials indexed in Current List of Medical Literature was derived and erected
from 21,000 citations secured in a random sampling of 1962 and 1961 biomedical
journals regularly received in the Yale Medical Library.. The author measures
the gross indexing effectiveness of Current List against his indexes of 
significance , offers his method  and results as means to reach objective
standards for indexing and abstracting, and projects his results  as measures
of general value of the serials analyzed..
