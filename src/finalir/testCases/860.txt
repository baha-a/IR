Standardized Costs for Automated Library Systems

Jacob, Mary Ellen L.

   Costs of the automated library systems as currently given in published 
reports tend to be misleading and confusing.. It is necessary to have a clear 
understanding of how they were derived before any comparisons can be made..
Clearly defined costs in terms of time units are more meaningful than straight 
dollar costs and can be used as one means of comparison among various system 
designs and as guidelines for the design of new systems..
