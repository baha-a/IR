	<title>The Potential Usefulness of Catalog Access Points OtherThan Author, Title, and  Subject	</title>
	<author>Cooper, William S.	</author>
	<text>
		   Library patrons who wish to obtain a known document with which they
		have had prior personal contact often cannot remember the standard author-
		title-subject information about it with sufficient accuracy to be able
		to look it up easily in present-day card catalogs.. However, they may
		remember a surprising amount of such "nonstandard" information as the
		color of the document's cover or its approximate length.. Could this
		type of "nonstandard" information be profitably exploited in computerized
		catalogs of the future?  Such facilities, if available, would surely be
		used, for according to catalog usage surveys a majority of today's
		library patrons seek known documents, and of these, a substantial
		minority possess nonstandard information.. In this report, the results of
		a memory experiment to test the memorability of various types of
		nonstandard information are described and analyzed.. A ranking according
		to relative memorability and potential retrieval usefulness of various
		nonstandard book features is given.. It is estimated that if the average
		patron's nonstandard information were exploited by appropriate retrieval
		strategies, he would only have to search through roughly one five-hundredth
		as many documents as in a random search.. This reduction factor is great
		enough to make nonstandard information potentially useful in many
		situations..
