		   The distribution of references in a collection of pertinent source documents
		can be described and predicted by the relation F(x) = ln(1 + bx)/ln(1 + b) where
		the parameter b is related to the subject field and the completeness of the
		collection.. The model is used to predict the reference yield of abstracting
		journals in a search for thermophysical property data.. It is used also to 
		explain differences among various literature studies of the past in terms of
		differences in subject and comprehensiveness of search.. The model is derived 
		from S.C. Bradford's 'law of scattering' and is called the Bradford 
		Distribution..
