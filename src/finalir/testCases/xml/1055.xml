		  The paper reports the results of a two week questionnaire survey of the use
		of biomedical periodical literature carried out at the UK National Lending 
		Library in February 1969.  The survey was designated to discover the subject,
		date and language characteristics of the borrowed literature, the most
		frequently requested journals, and the most popular sources of references
		to biomedical publications.
		  The loans were spread over 1,084 titles, although 9 per cent of the issues
		involved only 2 per cent of the titles.  The literature in most demand was
		less than one year old and in the case of medicine 50 per cent of the requests
		were for literature lss than 3 1/2 years old.  The half-life for the biological
		literature was somewhat longer at 5 3/4 years.  The majority of issues (87.8
		per cent) involved English language periodicals.
		  Overall, the principal sources of references to the requested literature
		were citation lists in other periodical articles.  Regarding the more recent
		literature, however, abstracting and indexing journals were the primary
		sources of information.  For medical references Index Medicus was the most
		used indexing publication, and for biological references Current Contents.
