	<title>Providing Bibliograhic Services From Machine-Radable Data Bases -The Library's Role	</title>
	<author>De Gennaro, Richard	</author>

		   Libraries will play a key role in providing access to data bases, but not by
		subscribing to tape services and establishing local processing centers as is
		commonly assumed.. High costs and the nature of the demand will make this 
		approach unfeasible.. It is more likely that the library's reference staff will
		develop the capability of serving as a broker between the local campus user and 
		the various regional or specialized retail distribution centers which exist or 
		will be established..
