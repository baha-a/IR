	<title>Effectiveness of Combining Title Words and IndexTerms in Machine Retrieval Searches	</title>

		  Our experiment was based on volume 24 of Nuclear Science
		Abstracts (NSA) which contains about 53,000 citations; we
		used the generalized file-management system, Master Control,
		which can operate in either an inverted or a linear search mode.
		The inverted mode uses a table composed of the unique
		vocabulary contained in one or more data elements, along with
		all record numbers in which each vocabulary word occurs.  For
		example, an inverted table constructed on titles will have one
		entry for each unique word of every title in the data base, plus
		the record numbers in which each vocabulary word occurs.  For
		example, an inverted table constructed on titles will have one
		entry for each unique word of every title in the data base, plus
		the record numbers in which each word was found.  (In Master
		Control, a word is defined as any set of characters bounded on
		either side by a legal separator such as a blank, period, comma,
		colon, etc.)  On the other hand, in a linear search mode the
		data element is compared with the profile word, character by
		character, which results in a prohibitively time-consuming
		process for large data bases.
		  We chose the inverted-table technique because of the large
		amount of data to be searched.  Individual tables were
		constructed from the titles of the articles, NSA index terms, and
		titles and index terms combined.  NSA index terms are controlled
		by the Euratom Thesaurus, as revised for NSA.
		  We used two criteria in the study.  First, the questions had
		to be of real interest to laboratory personnel.  Some of the
		questions had actually been submitted by other members of the
		staff, to be run concurrently on the same data base on an SDI
		basis.  The others were especially constructed by the authors
		for this experiment.  Second, citations obtained were to be
		considered good (or relevant) only if they actually pertained to
		the subject in question; otherwise, they were to be considered
		"false drops," regardless of the number of words matched
		between the profile and the citation.
