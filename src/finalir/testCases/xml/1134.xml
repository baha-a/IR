		   The statement of the problem and the results of an experiment in automatic
		choice of retrieval criterion are described.. The problem of criterion choice 
		is interpreted in terms of a pattern recognition problem.. The criteria chosen
		as a result of learning are considered, as well as the retrieval noise and 
		losses recorded in searches using these criteria.. The experiments suggest such 
		"limit" noise level which is not liable to any substantial further reduction..
		The efficiency of choosing a criterion through learning is discussed.. The
		relationship between information retrieval learning and nondeductive logic is
		investigated..
