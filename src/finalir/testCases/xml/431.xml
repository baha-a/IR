		Libraries 1940-1956 An Annotated Bibliography by Ralph H. Stenstrom.  The staff
		of the Library Research Center at the University of Illinois in cooperation
		with the Illinois State Library plans to issue an annual supplement which will 
		appear in Illinois libraries each year.  It is hoped the supplements issued in 
		this manner can be cumulated periodically and issued in monograph form.
