	<text>
		   A series of models of the interrelationship of scientific journals
		has been developed from the cross citing amongst 275 journals in
		mathematics, physics, chemistry, biochemistry, and biology..    
		The data source was the Journal Citation Index (JCI), a file derived
		from the Science Citation Index.. The JCI consists of a journal by
		journal tabulation of citings to and from each journal in the index..
		A large amount of consistency was found between the citing characteristics
		of the journals in the different scientific fields, with quite clear
		boundaries between fields and a few well known cross disciplinary
		journals as cross field information links..
		The separate disciplines appear to relate to each other in an orderly
		manner, with a natural sequence:  mathematics --> physics --> chemistry -->
		biochemistry --> biology.. Within disciplines the journals form fully
		transitive hierarchies with very few relational conflicts..
