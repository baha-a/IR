	<title>ISBD(S) and Title Main Entry for Serials	</title>

		  At the IFLA Liverpool Conference in 1971 a Joint working
		Group of the Committees on Cataloguing and on Serial Publications
		was set up to draw up an International Standard Bibliographic
		Description for Serials, taking the ISBD(M) as a model in
		so far as practicable.  As might be expected, the special problems
		presented by serial publications made the task of developing an
		ISBD(S) a difficult assignment which the Joint Working Group
		tackled with great energy and devotion.  The successive drafts
		were prepared by the Chairman and the Secretary, Mlle M.-L.
		Bossuat and Mlle M. Pelletier.
		  Probably no data element presented such a severe problem as
		that of serial title.  The seemingly countless Mitteilungen,
		Memoires, Proceedings, Bulletins, Trudy's, and the like seemed to 
		demand some useful and standardized way to be identified.  A
		solution to this problem was found in the adoption of a device
		which consisted of marrying the author statement to the generic
		title proper, with a wedding ring consisting of a space-hyphen-
		space and dubbing the happy couple the "distinctive title."
