		  In a ongoing study designed in part to evaluate
		and encourage continuing education programs in
		community hospitals Postgraduate Medical Institute
		(PMI) has determined that there is need for
		guidance in the area of medical-library development.
		Reports from PMI physician consultants who visited
		more than 40 community hospitals indicate that
		medical-library facilities are generally poor and 
		infrequently used by physicians.  The basic
		weaknesses of these libraries fall into four
		categories: inadequate collections, inadequate
		personnel, inadequate space, and the absence of
		any practical indexing system to facilitate use of
		collections that do exist.
		  Failure to deal with these problems does not
		reflect lack of interest but rather lack of stimulation
		to do so and absence of any concerted source of
		guidance.  In response to requests for such guidance
		PMI has undertaken a community hospital library
		development project in co-operation with the
		New England Regional Medical Library Service
		(NERMLS) at the Francis A. Countway Library of
		Medicine.  This report is concerned with the first
		phase of this project - namely, the formulation of
		a list consisting of a minimal number of textbooks and
		journals that can function as the core for a medical
		library.
		  Explanatory letters and questionnaires were sent
		to 400 specialists representing 50 areas of medical
		practice, including the basic sciences.  The
		specialists, chosen from regions throughout the
		country, were requested to recommend two textbooks
		and two journals in their area of special interest
		that they considered to be the most basic and 
		fundamentally useful for practitioners.  It was
		also requested that recommendations be made in order
		of preference.
