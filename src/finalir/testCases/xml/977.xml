		  Limited physical space expansion, an administrative
		consideration in every library, becomes a stringent factor in the planning
		of special libraries.  While public and college libraries may have  
		several decades of growth possibility when they take possession of a
		building or area, it is indeed a fortunate industrial library whose stacks are
		not overcrowded after five years of establishment in new quarters.  Industrial
		floorspace is too greatly in demand to devote more effort to the
		possible future growth of the library.	Weeding or storage requirements,
		therefore, are far more immediate considerations to the special industrial
		library administrators than they are to administrators of other types of
		libraries.  The limits of expansion are usually apparent earliest in the
		serials collections of industrial libraries because so much current
		technical data is published first in scientific and technical periodicals. 
		These collections grow rapidly.  This summarization of a recent study made
		by one technical library in the area of space for use of technical journals
		has potential for other libraries.
