	<title>Facsimile Transmission in Libraries:  A State of the Art Survey	</title>
	<author>Schatz, S.	</author>

		  Facsimile transmission is the rapid transmission of printed
		pages from one point to another using electronic devices.  All facsimile 
		transmission methods require converting the original picture into
		an electrical impulse which is then transmitted over telephone lines,
		private lines, microwave, or a combination of these communication
		links.  The receiving unit reconverts the electrical impulse into an exact
		duplicate of the original document on a screen or in the form of a hard
		copy.
