		  The material of this book is aimed at advanced undergraduate
		information (or computer) science students, postgraduate library
		science students, and research workers in the field of IR.  Some of the
		chapters, particularly Chapter 6, make simple use of a little advanced
		mathematics.  However, the necessary mathematical tools can be easily
		mastered from numerous mathematical texts that now exist and in any
		case references have been given where the mathematics occur.
