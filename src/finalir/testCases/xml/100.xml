	<title>Priorities in Scientific Discovery: A Chapter in the Sociology of Science	</title>

		  We can only guess what historians of the 
		future will say about the condition of
		present-day sociology.  But it seems
		safe to anticipate one of their observations.
		When the Trevelyans of 2050 come to write that 
		history - as they well might, for this clan
		of historians promises to go on forever -
		they will doubtless find it strange that so
		few sociologists (and historians) of the
		twentieth century could bring themselves,
		in their work, to treat science as one of the
		great social institutions of the time.  They
		will observe that long after the sociology of
		science became an identifiable field of
		inquiry, it remained little cultivated in a
		world where science loomed large enough to
		present mankind with the choice of destruction
		or survival.  They may even suggest
		that somewhere in the process by which social
		scientists take note of the world as it is
		and as it once was, a sense of values appears
		to have become badly scrambled.
