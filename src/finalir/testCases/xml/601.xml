	<title>Some Implications of Automatic Recognition of Bibliographic Elements	</title>
	<author>Shoffner, Ralph M.	</author>
	<text>
		   A theoretical approach to the problem of converting printed bibliographic 
		records to machine readable form is developed based on principles of system 
		analysis.. Experience from several recent projects conducted by the Institute of
		Library Research, University of California, are used to illustrate how this
		theoretical approach is currently being tested prior to implementation in a 
		large scale conversion project..
