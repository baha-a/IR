		  The objectives of the research were: 1) to determine actual requirements for
		library resources by elementary and secondary grade students and to
		evaluate existing library resources in terms both of student needs and national
		standards, and 2) on the basis of this information to outline the respective
		roles of the school libraries and the public libraries in providing needed
		resources and in developing joint planning.
