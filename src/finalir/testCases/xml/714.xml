		   Ten to 15 years ago, much technical literature was accurately indexed 
		according to strict rules of classification.. Today, because of the large
		amount of technical data written, it is no longer practical to apply the same
		rigid indexing procedures.. We should therefore be concerned with new search 
		techniques which will allow us to handle input at the lower level we are forced 
		to accept.. This paper describes such a search technique..
