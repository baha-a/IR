	<title>Some Cost Estimates for Bibliographical Searching in a Large-ScaleSocial Sciences Information System	</title>

		  Many of the large-scale mechanized information systems in operation today
		grew up because of the need of the military and para-military establishments
		to have rapid access to large quantities of scientific and technological
		information.  This paper will deal with two complementary efforts in the
		field of social sciences, where an awareness of the information problem is
		acute, and the global needs staggering.  The target audiences for these two
		systems are on the one hand social science researchers and on the other
		policy planners and makers in the broad field of economic and social 
		development.
		  An operational system (in the International Labour Office) will be
		described, and an array of figures representing actual or theoretical 
		operating costs will be given.  As could be expected, however, these
		figures relate only to costs of systems development, input preparation,
		file maintenance and retrieval.  No attempt can be made to evaluate in other
		than general terms the economic impact that the existence of such a system
		may have.  It can be readily demonstrated, however, that computer-assisted
		information systems may make sense within individual institutional
		environments, and make greater sense when on-line systems linking
		various collaborating institutions can result in enabling each to operate
		more efficiently and at lower cost.  The existence of such on-line
		networks would make the greatest sense for users because of the possibility
		of having access at a reasonable price to large information stores.
