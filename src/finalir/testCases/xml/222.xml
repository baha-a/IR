	<title>Review of Criteria Used to Measure Library Effectiveness	</title>
	<author>Evans, EdwardBorko, HaroldFerguson, Patricia	</author>
	<text>
		   This article reports the results of survey of literature on measures of 
		library effectiveness.. This survey led to the formulation of six criterion 
		concepts  (accessibility, cost, user satisfaction, response time, cost/benefit
		ratio and use).. The advantages and disadvantages of each method of 
		measurement are discussed.. Several points which became clear during the 
		analysis are discussed.. First, there is a relative lack of concern with the 
		rationale behind the evaluation process, although the results invariably lead
		to a confused interpretation when there is no clear understanding of the 
		purpose of an evaluation.. Second, the total library system is rarely 
		considered; instead, each evaluation criterion is taken in isolation rather
		than as part of the whole.. Third, the library's preservation function has not
		been considered at all..
