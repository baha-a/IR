	<title>Understanding Scientific Literatures:A Bibliographic Approach	</title>
	<author>Donohue, J.C.	</author>
	<text>
		  As the author states, the methods he describes treat the growth
		of a scientific literature as a social phenomenon in its own
		right, not as a material byproduct of the knowledge and
		concepts of the science written about.  Management of the
		literature of physics, say, does not first demand the study of
		physics, but of physicists.  Management of the literature of
		information sciences demands first the study of information
		scientists.
