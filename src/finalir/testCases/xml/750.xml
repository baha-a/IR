	<title>The Effect of Growth on the Obsolescence of Semiconductor Physics Literature	</title>
	<author>Oliver, Merrill R.	</author>
	<text>
		   Semiconductor physics literature is studied in order to investigate recent
		hypotheses relating obsolescence to the growth in periodical literature and the
		growth in the number of contributing scientists.. The results indicate that
		obsolescence remains constant and that the two growth rates are, within
		experimental error, of equal magnitude for this subject over a five-year 
		period.. These results are seen to be inconsistent with the assumption that an
		exponentially-growing literature possesses a constant utility..
