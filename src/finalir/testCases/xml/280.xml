	<title>User Circulation Satisfaction vs. Size of Holdings at Three Academic Libraries	</title>
	<author>Trueswell, Richard W.	</author>
	<text>
		   In an effort to determine certain facts concerning the relation of 
		circulation satisfaction to collection size, the author sampled the "last 
		circulation date" of stack books and of circulated books in three considerably 
		different kinds of academic libraries.. The experience of these three libraries 
		proved to be surprisingly similar.. The author speculates concerning potential 
		uses to which such data might be profitably applied..
