		  It is my purpose to single out two major information technologies that
		have already fostered considerable controversies - computer-based
		information storage and retrieval systems and photocopying technologies -
		and analyze the costs and benefits they have produced in various knowledge-
		sensitive circles of American society. I also suggest some immediate policy
		steps that might be taken concerning computers, photocopiers, and other
		information technologies.
