	<title>The MARC Pilot Project:The Final Report	</title>

		  The MARC project has progressed from a
		pilot to test the feasibility of a distribution
		service of centrally produced machine-readable
		cataloging data to a full-scale operational
		system in the design stages in two short years.
		The library community, both here and abroad, has
		accepted MARC and recognizes its potential
		for the future.  The single most significant
		result of MARC has been the impetus to set
		standards.  There is no doubt that eventually
		standards would have been designed for
		machine-readable bibliographic records, character
		sets, and codes for place and language.  MARC
		accelerated standardization and still more
		important, the standards are being set and agreed
		to be a large segment of the library community.
		The cooperation among the producers and users
		of bibliographic description has been a
		rewarding experience.
