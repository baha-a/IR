		  The object of this book is to establish a means for organizing
		collections of nonprint material so that greatest efficiency can match
		most effective service.  No lesser goal is worthy of consideration.
		In discussing the problems of organization, the examples of material
		have been used to explain differences in treatment that can be made
		responsive to the needs of the community that the library serves.
		Nonprint material is a vital part of a modern library of whatever
		type.  School libraries have made the greatest use of the material so
		far, to the point of becoming media-centers, but the avalanche of
		information is not only in print form and the need for information
		may often be satisfied only by nonprint material.
