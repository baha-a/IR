		  IFLA will be nearly fifty years old when Dorothy Anderson's UBC paper is
		published.  It is tempting to say that it is a half a century overdue.  When
		librarians first began to look beyond their national borders, bibliographic
		control was in the forefront of their concern.  Gradually, however, these
		pioneers of international librarianship began to realize that technical
		problems were too ambitious for multilateral action and in their discussions
		the emphasis was placed more on functions and organizations, on the social
		and even economic achievements of the international library community -
		which was not fully international at all - were limited to comparisons of
		national efforts, with some countries constantly over-critical and others 
		overgenerous.  Outstanding bibliographic projects, like the Gesamtkatalog der 
		Wiegendrucke, were international in scope, but national in conception.
