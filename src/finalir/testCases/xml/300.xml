	<title>Faculty Awareness and Attitudes Toward Academic Library Reference Services:A Measure of Communication	</title>
	<author>Nelson, Jerold	</author>
	<text>
		   A survey of the faculties at six colleges was undertaken to measure the 
		degree to which the libraries of those institutions were communicating with the
		faculty concerning the availability of various references services.. The results
		demonstrated that the average faculty member was aware of barely half the 
		services actually available.. Variables of academic rank, length of teaching, 
		and amount of library and reference use were some of the factors shown to 
		affect faculty awareness of library service..
