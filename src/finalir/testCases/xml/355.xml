		  During the last several decades, science and technology have
		undergone a drastic transformation.  The enormity and depth of this
		transformation can be measured in many ways.  It can be measured
		in terms of the number of students enrolled in graduate and
		undergraduate schools offering degrees in the physical and applied
		sciences, in terms of the number of new devices, products and
		innovations introduced into the military establishment and into the 
		civilian sector of our economy, in terms of the number of scientists and
		engineers employed by industry and public and private institutions,
		in terms of the amounts of money expended annually on research
		and development, in terms of the number of technical reports, books,
		journals, papers, reprints, and conference proceedings stemming
		from these expenditures, and in many other ways.
