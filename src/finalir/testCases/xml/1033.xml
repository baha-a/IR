	<title>The Making of a Library	</title>
	<author>Taylor, R.S.	</author>

		A book like this is a cumulation of experience, thought, error, and
		hopefully, learning of many years.  It did not start, like a water faucet, at
		precisely that moment in 1967 when the Office of Education so kindly
		awarded a grant to Hampshire college for the development of the concept
		of the extended and experimenting library, although the grant was certainly
		the means for, and a spur to, it formalization.
