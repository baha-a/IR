		  The small college has stood staunch in its desire to
		supply the liberal education and perhaps it has done
		well in maintaining this position.  On the other hand,
		many of the large universities have shifted the
		emphasis from undergraduate work to graduate study.
		Still others have tried to develop both side by side.
		Few of the small colleges have kept astride with the
		inevitable consequences of such a situation.  The
		few who have are sending an increasing number of
		their graduates to these universities to complete their
		training.  As an example of this, it is the boast of
		Pomona College that over seventy per cent of her
		graduates have taken subsequent professional training.
		It has become the evident duty, therefore, of the
		small college to prepare its men, not only to enter
		such graduate schools, but also to meet successfully
		the ever-increasing intensity of competition found
		there.  This in addition to supplying a broad
		cultural education.  This duty has brought with it
		a number of problems of first magnitude.  One of the
		biggest of these is the problem of adequate library
		facilities.
		  It is the purpose of this paper to discuss this
		problem with special reference to the student whose
		college major is chemistry.
