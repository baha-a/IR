	<title>Prejudices and Antipathies:A tract on the LC subject heads concerning people	</title>

		        Since the first edition of Library of Congress subject
		headings appeared 60 years ago, American and other libraries
		have increasingly relied on this list as the chief authority --
		if not the sole basis -- for subject cataloging.  There can
		be no quarrel about the practical necessity for such a
		labor-saving, worry-reducing work, nor--abstractly--about its
		value as a global standardizing agent, a means for achieving
		some uniformity in an area that would otherwise be chaotic.
		Undoubtedly, it is a real boon to scholars, as well as to
		ordinary readers, to find familiar, fairly constant headings
		in subject catalogs as far removed geographically as
		Washington, DC and Lusaka, Zambia.  Knowledge and scholarship
		are, after all, universal.  And a subject-scheme should, ideally,
		manage to encompass all the facets of what has been printed and
		subsequently collected in libraries to the satisfaction of the
		worldwide reading community.  Should, that is.  But in the realm
		of headings that deal with people and cultures--in short, with
		humanity--the LC list can only "satisfy" parochial, jingoistic
		Europeans and North Americans, white-hued, at least nominally
		Christian (and preferably Protestant) in faith, comfortably
		situated in the middle and higher-income brackets, largely
		domiciled in suburbia, fundamentally loyal to the Established
		Order, and heavily imbued with the transcendent, incomparable glory of 
		Western civilization.  Further, it reflects a host of untenable--indeed, 
		obsolete and arrogant--assumptions with respect to young
		people and women.  And exudes something less than sympathy or
		even fairness toward organized labor and the sexually unorthodox or
		"avant-garde."
