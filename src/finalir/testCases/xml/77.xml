	<title>The Effectiveness of Automatically Generated Weights and  Links in Mechanical Indexing	</title>
	<author>Artandi, SusanWolf, Edward H.	</author>
	<text>
		   Work concerned with the statistical evaluation of the output of the MEDICO 
		automatic indexing method is described.. The statistical test were designed
		primarily to examine the validity of the assumptions which formed the basis of 
		the algorithms developed for the automatic computation of weights and for the 
		automatic generation of links between index terms and modifiers.. This 
		evaluation also includes a comparison of the output generated from full text 
		and from the processing of the abstracts or summaries of the same articles..
