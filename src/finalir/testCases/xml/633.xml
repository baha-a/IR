		   The conventional method of preparing SDI (Selective Dissemination of
		Information) profiles often necessitates detailed interview sessions between 
		the client and one or more information scientists.. This research shows that by
		submitting samples of the client's recent professional reading material to 
		automatic text analysis, SDI profiles can be prepared that result in 
		significantly higher initial recall scores than do those prepared by 
		conventional techniques; relevance scores are not significantly different..
