		   The purpose of a university education is defined here as the need to guide
		the student towards becoming a self-directing individual.. This paper examines
		this purpose in terms of student needs and the awareness of both academic and
		library staff.. Psychological principles of learning as applied to this purpose
		are considered together with the use of audio-visual methods.. The paper ends
		with a consideration of some present practical constraints and the possibilities
		for future action..
