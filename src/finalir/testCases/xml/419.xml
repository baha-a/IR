	<title>A Statistical Approach to Mechanized Encoding and Searching of Literary Information	</title>
	<author>Luhn, H.P.	</author>
	<text>
		   Written communication of ideas is carried out on the basis of statistical 
		probability in that a writer chooses that level of subject specificity and that
		combination of words which he feels will convey the most meaning.. Since this
		process varies among individuals and since similar ideas are therefore relayed
		of different levels of specificity and by means of different words, the problem
		of literature searching by machines still present major difficulties.. A 
		statistical approach  to this problem will be outlined and the various steps
		of a system based on this approach will be described.. Steps include the 
		statistical analysis of a collection of document in a field of interest, the 
		establishment of a set of "notions" and the vocabulary by which they are
		expressed, the compilation of a thesaurus-type dictionary and index, the
		automatic encoding of documents by machine with the aid of such a dictionary,
		the encoding of topological notations (such as branches structures), the 
		recording of the coded information, the establishment of a searching pattern 
		for finding pertinent information, and the programming of appropriate machines
		to carry out a search..
