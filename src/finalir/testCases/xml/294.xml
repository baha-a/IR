	<title>Key Factors of Circulation System Analysis and Design	</title>
	<author>McGee, Rob	</author>
	<text>
		   Librarians must frequently judge circulation systems on the basis of widely 
		disparate descriptions that make comparisons difficult.. A way is needed to 
		place  various systems into a common perspective framework, so that their 
		similarities and differences can be readily understood.. This paper explains 
		basic (and largely familiar) concepts and components that are common to manual,
		machine-aided, and computer-based systems, and documents their significance as 
		key factors in the analysis and design of academic library circulation systems..
		Cost factors are not discussed..
