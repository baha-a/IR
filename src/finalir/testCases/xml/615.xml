	<title>A Cost Model for Evaluating Information Retrieval Systems    	</title>

		   This paper develops a mathematical model for use in studying how to 
		minimize the cost of operating a mechanized retrieval system.. Through 
		the use of cost analysis, the model provides a method for comparative
		evaluation between information retrieval systems.. The cost model divides the
		costs of a retrieval system into two components:  system costs and user costs..
		In addition, it suggests that a trade off exists between the performance
		level of the system and the combination of user and systems time that is
		expended in working with the system.. This minimizes the total cost of
		operating the system.. The allocation is done for a given performance level
		and for a given cost per unit of user and system time..
