		  This book is directed both to advanced college students
		enrolled in sociology courses and to students of the other
		social sciences (such as anthropology, economics, history,
		and psychology) who are concerned with diffusion.  (For this 
		reason, sociological concepts are defined when they are
		introduced.)
		  More than five hundred publications on the diffusion of
		innovations are reviewed here.  The innovations studied range
		from new drugs among physicians to hand tools among primitive
		tribes, and from driver training among public high 
		schools to hybrid corn among farmers.  Although a generally
		consistent set of findings has emerged from these studies, a
		search of the literature shows little attempt to summarize and
		evaluate available results and theories on the spread of ideas.
		This volume synthesizes these findings and theories.
