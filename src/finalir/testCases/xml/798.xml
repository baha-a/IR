	<title>The Thesaurofacet: A Multipurpose Retrieval Language Tool	</title>
	<author>Aitchison, Jean	</author>
	<text>
		   A description is given of the English Electric 'Thesaurofacet', a faceted 
		classification and thesaurus covering engineering and related scientific, 
		technical, and management subjects.. A novel feature of the system is the 
		integration of the classification schedules and thesaurus.. Each term appears
		both in the thesaurus and in the schedules.. In the schedules the term is
		displayed in the most appropriate facet and hierarchy: the thesaurus supplements 
		this information by indicating alternative hierarchies and other relationships 
		which cut across the classified arrangement.. The thesaurus also controls word 
		forms and synonyms and acts as the alphabetical index to the class numbers.. 
		The resulting tool is multipurpose, as easily applicable to shelf arrangement 
		and conventional classified card catalogues as to co-ordinate indexing and
		computerized retrieval systems.. The reasons are given for modifying certain
		traditional facet techniques, including the choice of traditional disciplines
		for main classes, the lack of a 'built-in' preferred order, and the use, in 
		certain instances, of enumeration rather than synthesis to express multi-term
		concepts.. Methods of application of the Thesaurofacet in pre-coordinate and
		post-coordinate systems are discussed and brief account is given of the 
		techniques employed in its compilation..
