		Purpose of this paper.  The purpose of this preliminary study is to attempt  
		to discover how far it succeeds at present and how far and by what methods
		it may continue to succeed or be made to succeed in the future.  One person
		(or two, for Brian Vickery is tackling the problem from the point of view
		of scientific and technological users) with however many helpful consultants
		can only hope to isolate some of the problems and to indicate some of the
		possible solutions.  This, it is hoped, may prepare the ground and stimulate
		the critical and creative efforts of others towards fruitful developments.
