		  Many segments of society are recognizing that
		access to information is a vital and fundamental
		contemporary need.  To provide optimum access
		it is essential to be able to retrieve information
		in whatever physical format it is found.  Such
		retrieval requires the development of cataloguing
		codes that will handle all media, including
		diverse kinds of audio and visual materials.
		To be most effective these cataloguing guidelines
		should be acceptable on an international level and
		should have the support of professional organizations
		most concerned with these problems.
