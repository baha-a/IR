	<title>Measures of Library Effectiveness	</title>

	<text>
		   Mathematical models of library operations are presented, allowing managers to
		estimate measures of effectiveness for a library.. These models describe the
		amount of use made of resources by a user in a visit, the distribution of book
		circulation in a collection, the dependence of circulation on time, and the 
		effect of multiple copies on user satisfaction.. Predictions are made on the 
		basis of the models of the consequence of breaking of central library into 
		branch libraries.. The effect, in terms of frustrated use, of removing the 
		least-used books from a collection is discussed, as are strategies for for
		duplication.. The emphasis is on facilitating getting results from models; for
		this purpose graphic techniques supplement the mathematical formulas..
