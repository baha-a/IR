	<title>Information Transfer Limitations of Titles of Chemical Documents	</title>

	<text>
		  Some methods of estimating the minimum amounts of information in a document
		not retrievable through its title are discussed.  An analysis of the information
		transferred by different types of keywords is helpful in planning search
		strategies, e.g., 30% of chemical substances mentioned in journal articles
		are not discernable in their titles even when broad class names are used
		as synonyms.  Patents have considerably less informative titles than journal
		articles.  In nuclear science, report titles are also less informative than 
		those of journal articles, but the proportion of reports with completely 
		uninformative titles is now only 10% of the 1957 value.  Titles in chemistry
		are more informative than those in most other fields, but the use of alerting
		and other services based on titles requires a good understanding of the
		underlying information transfer principles.
