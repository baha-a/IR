	<title>Some Behavioral Patterns of Library Users:  The 80/20 rule	</title>

		  A characteristic of inventory in business or industry
		is that approximately 80 percent of the number of
		transactions taken from a warehouse represents about
		20 percent of the items stocked.  This may also be
		considered as a ranking of stock items by their
		transaction activity which will show that the top 20
		percent of the stocked items (i.e., the most active
		items) account for about 80 percent of the total
		number of transactions.  The rule is sometimes
		expressed as the 75/25 rule with the same interpretation.
		It is only by coincidence that the figures add to 100
		as the phenomena relate to the relationships between
		the two statistical measures.
