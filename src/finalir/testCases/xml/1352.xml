		  The growing need for library space dictated a quantitative study to
		ascertain user requirements.  A monitoring operation has been established
		whereby data are continuously collected on the use made of periodicals shelved
		in a restricted storage area.  The data, obtained from photocopy request forms,
		identify the core collection of journals which satisfies 90% of our library 
		research requirements.
