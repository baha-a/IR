		    This paper reports a survey of the interlibrary loan operations at the
		National Library of Medicine.
		    The operations discussed here represent a significant departure from
		conventional interlibrary loan routines.  The substance of the present report
		pertains to the handling of interlibrary loans through the instrumentality of
		photoduplication.  This concept - providing photoduplicates of desired
		materials in lieu of loaning the originals - stems from thinking enunciated by
		Atherton Seidell, a member of the Friends of the Army Medical Library who
		pioneered in the development of photoduplication services.
