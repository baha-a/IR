		  This book is an experiment - in several respects.  The pressures of
		rising publication, together with the dazzling potentialities of the
		electronic computer, are forcing librarians to think more quantitatively
		about their libraries than most of them ever have before and, 
		simultaneously, have aroused the interest of the computer expert and
		the systems analyst in information storage and retrieval systems, of
		which the library is still the most successful exemplar.
