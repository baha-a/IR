	<title>R and D Project Selection:  Where We Stand	</title>
	<author>Baker, N.R.Pound, W.H.	</author>
	<text>
		   A review of the literature on R and D project selection and an analysis of 
		interview data suggest that there is a lack of testing and use of the methods
		proposed.. Several OR-MS methods are identified and their current status is
		indicated.. Three representative procedures are examined in some detail.. It is
		argued that both a lack of testing concerning feasibility and shortcomings of
		the models themselves, help to explain why the methods have not been used.. 
		Some of these shortcomings are identified and discussed.. Implications for 
		future research are presented..
