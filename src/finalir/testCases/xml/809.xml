		   ASSASSIN as designed and operated by ICI Agricultural Division, provides from
		a single paper tape input a current awareness service by SDI and a retrospective
		search both by a weighted term machine search and printed KWOC-type indexes.. 
		Programs for producing structured thesauri are part of the package.. Input is in
		the form of abstracts from both published and internal source..  
		   The system has operated for more than a year at the Agricultural Division and
		is currently in use at five other locations.. Flexibility of the package is
		demonstrated by the variety of applications..
		   This paper outlines the various applications and shows how a single package
		may be used complete, or in part, or with modification.. Machine costs are given
		for the major application..
		   The system was designed with the possible input of externally produced 
		machine readable data in mind.. The intended application of the package in
		conjunction with tapes such as those of the Institute for Scientific Information
		source and Chemical Abstracts Condensates is outlined..
