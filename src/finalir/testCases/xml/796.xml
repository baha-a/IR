		   The paper describes some properties of simple interconversion devices which
		enable material initially subject indexed by a particular indexing system to be
		made available to other institutions using different indexing languages in such 
		a form as to be readily integrated into their indexes.. Reference is made to the
		outline Intermediate Lexicon which is the germinal form of a switching language
		for the field of information science.. Difficulties and problems in effecting 
		satisfactory information transfer through such an interconversion scheme are
		explored, and suggestions made for the lines upon which further research needs
		to be undertaken.. The author was the Classification Research Group 
		representative on the international working party concerned with the 
		Intermediate Lexicon..
