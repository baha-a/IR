		  This Institute was designed both to encourage the use of
		quantitative measurement and to teach the techniques necessary
		for such use.  It was hoped that an emphasis on statistical
		measurement would upgrade administrative and research skills
		and thus contribute to more efficient and effective library
		management.
		  Studies of librarians' academic backgrounds have indicated
		a preponderance of humanities and social science majors in
		the field.  Too often librarians have had only a few courses in
		mathematics, and some actually have a psychological antipathy
		toward numbers.  This anti-mathematics syndrome has
		kept librarians from taking proper advantage of quantitative
		methods.
