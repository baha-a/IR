		  The Medical Library Association has long been aware of the need for a
		third edition of the Handbook.  Changes in library practices, proliferating
		demands upon established libraries, and the development of new ones
		created the need of an up-to-date tool.  Like the earlier editions,
		this Handbook is such a tool, a manual, not a survey of the state of the
		art.  It offers practical advice to all - fledgling librarians starting
		their careers, experienced librarians transferring to the field of
		health sciences, established medical librarians refreshing memories or
		adopting procedures unfamiliar to them, and specialists in related fields.
