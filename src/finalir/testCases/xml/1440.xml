	<title>Book Availability and the Library User	</title>
	<author>Guyton, T.L.	</author>
	<text>
		  The essentially logistical problem of making library books physically
		available when wanted by library users is central to librarianship.  This
		book is a tentative attempt to provide a treatise on this problem.  As such
		it has to deal with both theoretical analysis and the practicality of
		solutions.  No apology is made for the attention devoted to theoretical
		analysis, because the author believes that a clear conceptual understanding
		of the factors involved is important for improved librarianship.  The
		fact that analytical models are not always usable does not mean that the
		insight that can sometimes be derived from such analyses will not lead to
		a better understanding of the problems and, thereby, to improved library
		services.
