		        Social structures have changed more quickly during
		    the last one hundred years than during any other equivalent
		    period in history.  With these changes have come alternations
		    in the role of institutions of higher education.  During
		    the Centennial Year we shall try to measure the need and
		    nature of further change and to evolve ideas that may
		    influence its direction.
		
		    In keeping with this idea, the Graduate School of Library Science
		of the University of Illinois felt that this indeed was a time propitious
		for holding an International Conference on Education for Librarianship.
		The profession as a whole and library education in particular are still
		quite young, but in less than one hundred years we have seen revolutionary
		changes.  Demands have been made on the world's libraries, and in turn on
		the schools' training personnel for these libraries, almost too rapidly
		for them to satisfy.  It seemed logical for library education, therefore,
		"to measure the need and nature of future change and to evolve ideas that
		may influence its direction."
