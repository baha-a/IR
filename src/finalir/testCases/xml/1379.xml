		  State library policy is the focus of this study.  The approach to policy
		is framed in the broadest possible terms currently permitted by empirical
		research in the examination of governmental policy formation.  A major
		purpose of the study is to analyze state library policy in relationship to
		the environment which provides the backdrop for its formation and
		maintenance.  The authors see this ambitious effort as a pioneering
		thrust in library research and not as the final work on library policy.
