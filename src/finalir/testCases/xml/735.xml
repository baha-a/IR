		  The purpose of this paper is to present up-to-date
		material to indicate some of the changes that have taken
		place during and since World War II.  For purposes of
		comparison, the work of Patterson and Sheppard is
		represented in abbreviated form in Tables 1 and 2.  The
		results of our own study are presented as Tables 3 and 4.
		The reader can draw several obvious conclusions.  About
		half of all the citations in Tables 3 and 4 are to papers
		published in the 1950's.  This, in part, reflects the
		present highly vigorous state of chemical investigation
		and its rapid expansion in recent years.  Another striking
		fact is that in the Journal of the American Chemical
		Society, 39.5% of the citations are to previous work
		published in the journal itself.  In Industrial and
		Engineering Chemistry, the percentage of self citations
		is 21.3.  To some extent this may result from the fact
		that writers who habitually publish in a particular
		journal tend to cite their own work.  However, it seems
		to reflect to a greater degree the dominance of these
		journals in their respective fields.  More than 38%
		of the citations in Industrial and Engineering Chemistry
		are to various American Chemical Society publications.
		In the Journal of the American Chemical Society more than
		45% of the citations are to Society publications.
