	<title>A Standard Format of Progress Reports on Scientific Technical Information	</title>
	<author>Kruglov, S. L.	</author>
	<text>
		   A standard format of progress reports is suggested, based on the experience
		of research institutes and drawing offices.. The schedule of reports and each 
		of their sections proceed from the need for maximum "noise-resistance" of
		reports as used by various categories of users and giving an exhaustive 
		description of final and intermediate RandD results.. The author shows that the
		difference between the notion of "information value" and of "document value"
		dictates a specific approach to organization of the flows of documentary
		information, duplication of data in documents of various kind, and to 
		development of the logical format and literary style of scientific documents..
