		   To explore their use of on-line computer-based bibliographic search services,
		a one-page questionnaire was sent to 100 academic libraries in the United 
		States having separate departmental chemistry or science libraries.. An attempt
		was made to determine the background training of the persons performing the
		searches, who the end users were, the growth trend, the funding, the data
		bases used, and the value to the users.. Of the 73 replies, 49.3% indicated use
		of such services, while 24.6% were planning to use them primarily by faculty
		and graduate students.. Of those reporting, 83.3% used searchers with a 
		background in library or information science; 47.2% had a background in 
		scientific discipline..Two or more on-line services were used by 72.2%.. A 
		majority of respondents stated that the use paid all expenses or a portion of 
		the expenses.. The searches met the needs of the use most of the time in 83.3% 
		of the cases, and all of the time in 5.4%..
