		This report describes the results of automatic processing
		of a large number of scientific papers according
		to a rigorously defined criterion of coupling.  The
		population of papers under study was ordered into 
		groups that satisfy the stated criterion of interrelation.
		An examination of the papers that constitute the
		groups shows a high degree of logical correlation.
