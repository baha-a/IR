		  The essay that follows is the first full published report on a
		project originally conceived almost fifteen years ago.  At that
		time I was a graduate student in theoretical physics already
		within sight of the end of my dissertation.  A fortunate involvement
		with an experimental college course treating physical
		science for the non-scientist provided my first exposure to
		out-of-date scientific theory and practice radically undermined
		some of my basic conceptions about the nature of science and
		the reasons for its special success.
