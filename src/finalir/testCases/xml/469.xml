		   Discusses the various explicit and implicit definitions of information and
		information science, against a view of their historical development.. Shows how
		the various views of information science overlap with other disciplines, and
		concludes with a proposal for a definition of information science based on 
		social need.. A schema of information sciences is put forward with the plea that
		any discussion of information and information science should first declare the
		definitions to be used..
