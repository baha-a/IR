		   The various premises, which need consideration when developing a realistic 
		and flexible information storage, retrieval and dissemination (ISRD) system, 
		are discussed; their implication is illustrated with some examples from the 
		development of the system at "Shell" Research, Sittingbourne..
		   One of the factors which will affect the satisfactory performance of an ISRD
		system is the ease with which relevant literature information not held in the 
		system can be provided..
		   The later part of the paper is developed to a discussion of this problem and
		of a possible means of dealing with it in the not too distant future..
