	<title>Serials Data Control:  Current Problems and Prospects	</title>
	<author>Fasana, P.	</author>
	<text>
		  This paper will describe three areas of current serials activity which are
		of importance to conventional libraries.  I would like to do this in general
		terms, eschewing details which only seem to serve to confuse.  The three
		areas are:
		  l. Standards.  What they are, what impact they can have, what influence
		     they currently are having on serials processing.
		  2. Standards Setting Projects. I will attempt to describe and/or define
		     the almost incestuous intricacies of the National Serials Data Program
		     (NSDP), the International Serials Data System (ISDS), and CONSER
		     (CONversion of SERials).
		  3. Code Revision Activities.  I will outline the influence that current
		     standards and projects are having on code revision activities.
		  My comments are to be considered within the context of conventional
		libraries, primarily one wherein card catalogs still exist and manual processes
		are the rule.
