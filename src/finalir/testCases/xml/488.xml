		   This report summarizes the work carried out on the automatic construction of
		keyword classifications and their use in information retrieval that we have 
		carried out in the last eighteen months.. It discusses the possible 
		characteristics of such classifications, and potential ways of using them; and 
		described the various approaches to classification we have considered, in terms
		of an overall frame of reference in which several types of classification are 
		distinguished.. The results of experiments using a collection of documents and
		test requests obtained from the Aslib Clanfield project are presented, from 
		which it can be conclude that automatic classifications which lead to noticeable
		improvements in retrieval performance over those obtainable with unclassified 
		terms can be set up..
