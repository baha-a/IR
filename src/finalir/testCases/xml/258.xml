		  The first problem, that of learning of a publication's existence, is
		tackled by a multiplicity of abstracting and indexing journals and
		other bibliographies, and, at local levels, by library catalogues and
		unnecessary overlapping among these services, while ensuring
		adequately comprehensive coverage, are very great.  But even if
		these were overcome, problems of the internal arrangement of these
		bibliographical aids would still remain.  It is not enough for them
		collectively to record every scientific publication.  The user must be
		able to find every such record, starting only with a subject on which
		he wants information.
