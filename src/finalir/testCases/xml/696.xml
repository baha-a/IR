		   To compare computerized services in chemistry, pharmacology, toxicology, and 
		clinical medicine of pharmaceutical interest, equivalent profiles were run on 
		magnetic tape files of CA-Condensates, CBAC, Excerpta Medica, MEDLARS and
		Ringdoc.. The results of these searches, which covered individual chemical 
		compounds used in pharmacology and medicine, are tabulated overlap of services,
		relative speed of citing references, and unique areas of journal coverage..
