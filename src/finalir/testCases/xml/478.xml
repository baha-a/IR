	<title>Concept Organization for Information Retrieval	</title>

		  All analysis of information for storage and of questions for effecting
		retrieval must be in terms of concepts and the relations between them.
		The concepts may be just words (descriptors), as in simple post-co-ordinate
		keyword indexing systems, or they may be class-terms or other idea-groupings,
		as in classifications.  The relations between concepts often appear to be
		absent, but if more than one word is used in indexing or in a search there is
		clearly an implicit relation between them in the mind of the indexer or
		questioner, and other relations possible between the words would lead to
		false drops.  Classification has traditionally been a method of organization
		of concepts in which the relations between concepts are ostensibly displayed
		in the form of groupings called classes.
