		    Since 1958 when the first edition of the present work was
		issued, additional studies, research programs and experimentation
		have contributed to changes in personnel work and the large area
		of human relations.  The impact of these developments has been
		and should be felt in libraries as well as in industry, government
		and business.  The present edition views all the aspects of personnel
		work in the context of the most useful of the newer developments.
