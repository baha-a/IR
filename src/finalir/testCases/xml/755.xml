		  This paper examines the implications of the findings of evaluative tests
		regarding the retrieval performance of natural language in various subject
		fields.  It suggests parallel investigations into the structure of natural
		language, with particular reference to terminology, as used in the different
		branches of basic science.  The criteria for defining the terminological
		consistency of a subject are formulated and a measure suggested for
		determining the degree of terminological consistency.
		  The terminological and information structures of specific disciplines such
		as, chemistry, physics, botany, zoology, and geology; the circumstances in
		which terms originate; and the efforts made by the international scientific
		community to standardize the terminology in their respective disciplines -
		are examined in detail.  This investigation shows why and how an artificially
		created scientific language finds it impossible to keep pace with current
		developments and thus points to the source of natural language.
