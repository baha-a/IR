		   The citation characteristic of papers in the Monthly Notices of the Royal
		Astronomical Society (especially for the years 1963-5) have been examined as a 
		means of studying the usage of astronomical literature in the United Kingdom..
		The decrease of usage with age has been investigated and the decay half-life 
		determined.. Particular attention has been paid to the immediacy affect, and
		to its possible variation in different sub-fields of astronomy.. The citations
		have also been separated according to journal of origin.. As a result of this 
		study, a quantitative estimate has been made of the titles and backruns that are
		required to satisfy a given percentage of the demand for astronomical research
		literature in the country..
