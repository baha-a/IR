	<title>Out of the Dinosaurus; the evaluation of the National Lending Library forScience and Technology	</title>

		  The establishment of the National Lending Library for Science
		and Technology (NLL) has been one of the most significant events
		in British librarianship in the twentieth century.  This book attempts
		to trace the development of the library up to its merger into the
		impending British Library, and to describe the philosophies which
		shaped its policies and services.  I hope that the book will be of
		value to British and overseas librarians as a case study of the
		development of a national library, and also to students of librarianship
		and information work in that it may help them to appreciate the context
		in which the library has evolved and in which it now operates.
