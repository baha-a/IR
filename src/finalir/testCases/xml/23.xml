		This project was undertaken because of the
		high degree of uncertainty among the library
		staff regarding the extent of the problem of
		missing books.  The findings of this study gave
		the Ohio State University libraries concrete
		evidence as to how many books are missing
		and indicated the areas in which book losses
		are the greatest.  These figures also provide
		information which can be conveyed to the
		faculty or administration when they voice
		complaints about the unavailability of library
		books.  The areas where losses are high also
		tend to indicate the areas of most frequent
		use.
