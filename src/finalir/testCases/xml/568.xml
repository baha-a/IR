		  Pattern recognition has been introduced to the
		chemical literature as a general tool which can be used
		by the chemist to reduce masses of experimental data to
		relevant information.  Perhaps more importantly, it
		provides connections between raw, multivariant data
		and sought-for information without making restrictive
		assumptions about the underlying statistics of the data.
		The general problem has been stated as follows.  Given
		a collection of objects and a list of measurements made
		on each object, is it possible to find and/or predict a
		property of the objects that is not directly measurable
		but is known to be related to the measurements via
		some unknown relationship?  The only assumption
		made is that similarities and dissimilarities among
		objects are reflected in at least some of the
		measurements.
