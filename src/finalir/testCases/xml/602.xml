		   At the frontiers of an active area of science, social structure based upon 
		communication is demonstrated.. Using sociometric techniques, an informal
		communication network was identified which included 73% of the scientists..
		Within the network was a core group of scientists who were the focus of a
		disproportionately large number of contacts and who were differentiated from
		others by greater productivity, higher citation record and wider readership..
		Information transferred to these scientists is so situated that it could be
		transmitted to 95% of the network scientists through one intermediary scientist
		or less..
