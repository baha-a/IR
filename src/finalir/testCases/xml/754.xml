	<title>A Test for the Separation of Relevant and Non-Relevant Documents in Experimental Retrieval Collections	</title>

		   Many retrieval experiments are intended to discover ways of improving 
		performance, taking the results obtained with some particular technique as a 
		baseline.. The fact that substantial alterations to a system often have little 
		or no effect on particular collections is puzzling.. This may be due to the 
		initially poor separation of relevant and non-relevant documents.. The paper 
		presents a procedure for characterizing this separation for the collection, 
		which can be used to show whether proposed modifications of the base system are 
		likely to be useful..
