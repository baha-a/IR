		requirements at the Library, University of Saskatchewan: 1) entry/title access
		to MARC tapes; 2) entry/title access to the acquisitions and cataloguing 
		in-process file; and 3) entry/title duplicate order edit within the 
		acquisitions and cataloguing in-process file.. The study which produced the 
		code and applications for the code are discussed..
