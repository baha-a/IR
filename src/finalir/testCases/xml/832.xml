	<title>The Status of 'Practicum' in Graduate Library Schools	</title>
	<author>Grotzinger, L.	</author>
	<text>
		  The early schools were dedicated to practical work as a
		necessary component of every program; this fact is
		heavily documented in numerous commentaries on the time.
		As this century progressed, however, this pioneer 
		preoccupation came under strong criticism and by the 
		1930's and in more recent decades, an equally strong
		documentation attacks the earlier curricula.  Now, in
		the 1970's amid the many questions raised about the
		relevance of contemporary library education, there
		appears to be a revival in the use of field experiences.
