	<title>On-Line Access to Information: NSF as an Aid to the Indexer/Cataloger	</title>
	<author>Bennet, John L.	</author>

		   When adding a document to a collection, an indexer should choose a 
		representation which makes evident both the content of the document and its 
		relation to other documents already in the collection.. Toward this end, the 
		Negotiated Search Facility (NSF) makes possible indexer-controlled retrieval of 
		information from a collection data base using tools beyond those available in a
		traditional bibliographic catalog.. The design philosophy of NSF is to offer a 
		framework to guide the indexer while allowing him freedom to retrieve any data 
		which he judges will help him make indexing decisions.. An example which 
		indicates how an indexer might use the facility also shows how the display
		formats and command language promote interaction.. While the discussion is 
		directed toward indexing, it should be clear that the facility would be equally
		useful to the searcher..
