		The intense development of science and its immediate application in production
		is one of the characteristic feelings of our time. The growth of the economy 
		now depends more and more on the speed of scientific research.
		One of the main tasks of the five-year plan (1971-1975) is to develop in every
		possible way basic and applied scientific research and to rapidly introduce their
		results into the national economy.
		The Directives of the 24th Congress of the CPSU emphasize the need to improve
		scientific-technical information, and to guarantee the systematic transfer to
		interested fields and institutions of information on scientific achievements
		and progressive experimentation in the areas of technology, the organization of
		production, and production management.
