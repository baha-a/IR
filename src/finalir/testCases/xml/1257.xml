		  The focus of the report is primarily upon the problems of the large,
		university, research-oriented library.  It is here that one finds the most
		difficult resource-access and bibliographical control problems.  If one can
		significantly improve both of these operations for the large, research-oriented
		institutions, there are likely to be direct or indirect benefits for the
		smaller library, while the reverse situation is much less likely.
