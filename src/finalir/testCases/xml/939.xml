	<title>The Paradoxes of Library Cooperation	</title>
	<author>Dougherty, R.M.	</author>

		  The need for libraries to cooperate has long been recognized, as countless
		articles written within the past decade will attest.  Moreover, the necessity to
		combine forces has never been as apparent as it is today.  Because the cost of 
		self-sufficiency has become undeniably prohibitive, libraries can no longer 
		afford to act as free agents.  Voluntary library
		cooperation is no natural manifestation of social interaction.  Rhetoric alone 
		is a impotent agent of change.  In truth, cooperative programs succeed only 
		as long as each participant perceives the arrangement as beneficial to his
		institution.
