		  This volume represents what we believe to be as complete
		and thorough an analysis as possible of the available economic
		data on college and university libraries.  In the course
		of our study, we have examined the data for comprehensiveness
		and consistency; we have investigated their intertemporal
		behavior, both as a basis for projection and as an
		instrument for long-range planning; and we have constructed
		a set of analytic interrelationships which permit us to derive
		statistical estimates of the interrelations of some of the most
		critical economic variables relating to library operations.  In
		particular, in the course of this last step, we have provided
		relationships explaining statistically the determination of
		such variables as the size of libraries' budgets and the
		magnitude of their professional staffs.
