		   The results are described of research and development activities of the 
		Mechanized Information Retrieval Laboratory of the NIITEKHIM.. Research 
		Institute aimed towards creating a descriptor language for an information
		retrieval system in the field of chemistry and chemical engineering.. The
		objectives of an optimum reduction of retrieval noise and maximum recall have 
		required the introduction of grammatical and transformational devices into the
		language.. The former condition is provided for by a matrix notation of 
		document search patterns and requests, while the latter condition is met with
		the help of the transformational devices of the language..
		   Examples of search requests and patterns are considered, which illustrate
		the "resolution" of the grammatical and transformational devices being 
		developed.. These are said largely to eliminate subjectiveness in assigning
		relational factors in search patterns and requests..
		   The relevancy criterion is formulated.. A retrieval algorithm based on this
		criterion has been compiled..
		   Experimental searches were conducted on a Minsk-22 computer.. The results 
		were analyzed to evaluate the grammatical and transformational devices and to
		verify indexing principles devised for the automated retrieval system under
		development..
		   Factors of "silence" are discussed, as well as the contribution of the 
		grammatical and transformational devices to reducing noise and enhancing 
		recall..
