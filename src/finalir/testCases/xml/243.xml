		  In April 1970, the CAN/SDI project, developed
		by the Canadian National Science Library,
		completed its first year of operation.  At that
		time the project, designed as a national service
		to alert scientists and technologists to current
		information in specific fields of research, was
		serving over six hundred and fifty subscribers
		requiring a total of more than three thousand
		five hundred individual computer queries.  Over
		one thousand personalized bibliographies are
		prepared each week from commercially available
		data bases purchased from Chemical
		Abstracts Service, the Institute for Scientific
		Information (ISI) and the British Institution of
		Electrical Engineers.  A detailed description of
		the service was given in a paper by J.E.
		Brown published in October 1969.
