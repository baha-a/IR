		   The authors investigate the impact of a bibliographic retrieval/card
		production system, such as the Ohio College Library Center (OCLC), with special
		attention to its role in cataloging.. Activities required at the local level to
		make the LC card a functioning component of the catalog are described.. The
		characteristics of the ensuring workload are examined, along with methods of
		accomplishing it.. These activities are seen as a factor in the persistence of
		backlogs.. The design of OCLC, because of the immobility of the terminal and
		the absence of the catalog from the data base, by-passes this workload, leaving 
		the local library to accomplish it by the method of its choice, as before, or 
		to leave it undone..
