	<title>Participative Management in Relation to Library Effectiveness	</title>
	<author>Lynch, Beverly	</author>
	<text>
		   This paper reviews a recent study on the influence of participative 
		management on library performance.. Because most of the recent theoretical and 
		empirical research being done in this area is ignored and an invalid measure of
		participation in decision making is used, the study provides no basis for the
		generalization that in increase in the library staff's participation in 
		decision making will increase the library's effectiveness..
