		  The purpose of this study is:  (1) to
		review the history of the struggle for faculty status for
		librarians and some of the arguments advanced in support of
		that objective; and (2) to gather information on the 
		similarities and differences between librarians and faculty 
		members in the broad areas of preparation, contributions,
		and rewards.  With detailed information on such matters
		as education, salaries, professional experience, tenure, sabbaticals,
		participation in academic government, and scholarly activity
		of librarians and faculty members, one should be able to
		judge whether librarians receive unfair or unequal treatment.
