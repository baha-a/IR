	<text>
		   A statistical model for characterizing the growth patterns of data base
		utilization and for estimating future utilization levels of demand has been
		developed for information retrieval organizations.. The model developed is
		y = b( 1 - e(**-at) ) where y is the number of users of a data base at time t,
		and a and b are parameters to be estimated.. Illustrations of the model applied 
		to a typical information retrieval organization are given and discussed..
