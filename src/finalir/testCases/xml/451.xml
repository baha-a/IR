	<title>Interaction Between Requesters and a Large Mechanized retrieval System	</title>
	<author>Lancaster, F.W.	</author>
	<text>
		   In a large mechanized retrieval system, a certain proportion of the search
		failures are likely to be directly attributable to inadequate user-system 
		interaction.. Request statements may be only distant  approximations of
		actual information requirements.. This paper discusses some of the problems of
		the user-system interface and suggests methods whereby these problems may be
		alleviated..
