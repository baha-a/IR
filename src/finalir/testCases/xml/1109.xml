		   The paper describes a system of analysis of primary science journals from
		the standpoint of the efficiency of their use as sources for abstracting in
		conjunction with punched cards and electronic computers..  The procedure
		employed to process the file of science documents is outlined..
		   The program of analysis provides for obtaining statistical data on the
		regularities of the concentration of special profile periodicals and the
		scattering of the interdisciplinary sources as well as the characteristics
		of the systems of relations existing between the individual series of the 
		abstract journal..
