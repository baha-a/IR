		  The first diagram below gives a schematic view of a subject literature that
		is growing exponentially with time - the number of items published per
		year doubles in five years.  Each square of the paper represents a published
		item.
		  The marks on the diagram represent current uses of the literature (say,
		citations made or items borrowed this year).  The inked squares are actual
		uses.  The dots are hypothetical uses - those that would occur if every 
		published item had an equal chance of being used (in fact, every fifth item is
		dotted).
