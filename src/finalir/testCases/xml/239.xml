		  This is the second book based on studies into social aspects 
		of book reading.
		  The present book is largely a report on work which was
		carried out in 1967-68 but either not analysed or written
		up in time for the first book, or work actually carried out
		and analysed during the second year's research.  The reader
		of this book will find it useful to have read the first book,
		but the present book is self-contained and does not require
		reference to the first one.
