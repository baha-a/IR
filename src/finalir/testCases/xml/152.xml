		  For about five years now a small group of us at MIT
		have been conducting a series of investigations into the
		information needs of technologists, the manner in which
		these needs are presently met, the relation between
		various ways of fulfilling information needs and technological
		performance, and the nature of factors which determine the ways
		in which information needs will be fulfilled.
