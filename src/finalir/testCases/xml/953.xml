	<author>Fussler, H.H.	</author>
	<text>
		  This is the second of two papers dealing with the characteristics of the
		literature used by research chemists and physicists in the United States.  
		The method of the study was fully outlined in th first article and will
		therefore not be repeated here.   The previous paper was devoted to a
		discussion of the importance of the literature of various subject fields to
		research in chemistry and physics.  The remarks that follow are directed
		primarily to a discussion of the temporal span of the literature, the principal
		forms of the literature, the national origins of the literature used in the 
		United States, and some attention is devoted to the more important serial
		titles.
