		  No code of cataloguing could be adopted in all points by everyone,
		because the libraries for study and the libraries for reading have different
		objects, and those which combine the two do so in different proportions.
		Again, the preparation of a catalogue must vary as it is to be manuscript
		or printed, and, if the latter, as it is to be merely an index to the
		library, giving in the shortest possible compass clues by which the
		public can find books, or is to attempt to furnish more information on
		various points, or finally is to be made with a certain regard to what
		may be called style.
