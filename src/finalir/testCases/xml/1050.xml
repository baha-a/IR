	<title>Medical Innovation: a diffusion study	</title>
	<author>Coleman, J.S.	</author>

		  The research reported here constitutes a case study in the acceptance
		of an innovation.  The innovation is a medical one, a drug which
		physicians use in everyday practice; the setting is in the Midwestern
		United States in the 1950's.  This study gives a glimpse of one small
		part of the great changes that have recently occurred within medicine
		and thus is of specific interest to the medical profession and its
		allied institutions.
		  But more generally, the question of the spread of an innovation
		is of interest to all students of society.  Particularly in an age of
		change, and in our complex and massive society, an understanding
		of the way in which an innovation can spread - for better or worse!
		- constitutes important knowledge of man.  It is to aid in this
		understanding, as well as to describe the case at hand, that this report
		is written.
