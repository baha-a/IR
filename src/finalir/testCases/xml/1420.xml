		        Any who have the arduous task of assisting a student
		through that ultimate of academic exercises, the preparation
		and defense of a dissertation, are likely to define happiness
		as a good book written by an advisee.  This book is a cause
		of joy.  The author expended much more effort than is usually
		the case to gain even the smallest detail, because the subject
		matter is strangely intractable, hedged round with perplexities
		and not a few vested interests.  Letters and reports get locked
		away where they may not be seen except by the most persistent
		investigator and one who somehow meets criteria that no one else
		can claim.  In the end, the author deserves the praise and the
		advisor is well rewarded with the inner satisfaction that comes
		from participation in an important investigation finished as an
		influential and well-written book.
