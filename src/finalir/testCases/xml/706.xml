		  There are many chemical retrieval systems which
		process the first type of request efficiently.  Most of these
		systems are also capable of handling certain fragment
		requests; however, the fragments which can be processed
		are frequently of a restricted nature.  For example, in
		retrieval systems which are based on linear ciphers, only
		those fragments which are explicit in the cipher are
		readily detected.  To allow a completely general 
		specification of fragments it seems inevitable that a
		detailed atom-by-atom comparison is required of the query
		and library structures.  A technique for making such detailed
		comparisons is presented in this report.  This technique
		is novel in that it avoids the excessive backtracking ad
		restarting required by other atom-by-atom matching
		procedures.
		  Before giving the details of the proposed algorithm,
		some definitions are reviewed and a brief example is
		presented to illustrate the over-all concepts.  Then the flow
		diagram of the algorithm is explained in terms of additional
		examples.  Finally, the mechanization of the algorithm for
		a digital computer is discussed.
		  This report is a condensed version of the original, which
		gives a generalization and comprehensive description of
		the algorithm, proofs of convergence and related topics,
		and applications other than chemical retrieval systems.
