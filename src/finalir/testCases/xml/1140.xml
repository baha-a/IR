	<title>On the Symbolic Nature of Classifications	</title>
	<author>Panova, N. S.Shreider, Yu. A.	</author>
	<text>
		   The nature of an arbitrary classification is considered from the viewpoint
		of its sign function.. The structure of the taxons described by a given 
		classification is treated as the referent (the denotate).. The formation of
		taxons is shown to be connected with the preliminary arrangement of the subject
		area into a classification field..
		   The classification concept is connected with the structure and nature of
		the classification characteristics.. A typology of classifications is 
		introduced, distinguishing them by intensionality, or capacity for expression
		of the concept independent of the subject area.. Differences are pointed out
		that exist between the classificatory and thematic relationships and the 
		correlations between these two groups of relationships are analyzed..
