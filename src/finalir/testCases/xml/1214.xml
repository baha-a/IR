	<title>The Practice of Management	</title>
	<author>Drucker, P.F.	</author>
	<text>
		  We have available today the knowledge and experience needed
		for the successful practice of management.  But there is probably no
		field of human endeavor where the always tremendous gap between
		the knowledge and performance of the leaders and the knowledge
		and performance of the average is wider or more intractable.  This
		book does not exclude from its aims the advancement of the frontier
		of knowledge; it hopes, indeed, to make some contribution to it.
		But its first aim is to narrow the gap between what can be done and
		what is being done, between the leaders in management and the
		average.
