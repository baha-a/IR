		  Several features of the University of Georgia Information Dissemination 
		Center, including current awareness, or SDI, and retrospective search services, 
		the information specialists who provide the interface between the user and the
		computer system, and an experimental network linking individual centers, are
		discussed.  A survey which assessed the impact of the services on the 
		information habits of the university users is also discussed.  Over 97% of the 
		survey respondees indicated that the services had contributed to their 
		professional activities.  Some users reported that the service had been
		a method of bypassing library reference works; others indicated that the
		service had brought them back into the  library and made them aware of 
		information sources previously unknown to them.
