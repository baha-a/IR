		   The SMART document retrieval system is used to investigate algorithms for
		text analysis and request searching.. Results from three document collections 
		indicate that word normalization is efficiently performed by automatic thesaurus
		lookup, while phrase matching procedures, statistical association methods, and 
		concept hierarchies are useful for special applications.. Automatic document 
		clustering schemes and use-interactive feedback methods permit rapid searches of
		large collections.. Abstracts are found to be superior to titles as a base for
		content analysis in a document retrieval system and almost as good as complete
		texts.. Proper procedures for designing dictionaries and searching requests
		are discussed..The practicality of large scale document centers and their proper
		design are considered in light of these results..
