		  The study as a whole is designed to stimulate public librarians
		to re-examine realistically their most useful function and greatest
		potential contribution at a time when methods of communication
		are undergoing rapid change.  As the traditional custodian of the
		printed word, the librarian has long had a distinctive and widely
		accepted role.  The Public Library Inquiry, especially in the concluding
		chapter of the present volume, brings to the center of attention problems
		and suggestions for change challenging a fresh appraisal.  It should
		arouse the interest of the public served by the libraries as well as aid
		the librarians themselves to an appreciation of an important American
		institution that must be kept ever alert to the needs of a democratic
		society.
