		  The form and function of the journal as a medium
		of communication between scientists, that is, one scientist
		talking to another, have not changed greatly these past 100
		years.	But during that time, the journal has evolved to a
		highly effective medium for meeting the scientists' needs
		for publication, distribution, storage, and retrieval of scientific
		information.  Kessler describes the journal as the most
		"successful and ubiquitous carrier of scientific information in
		the entire history of science."  And the scientific paper, he
		adds, "is such a marvelous and commodating invention that we
		seem to take it for granted and forget that it has form and
		structure that fit its function."
