	<title>Communication and Information Processing within Scientific Disciplines:Empirical Findings for Psychology	</title>
	<author>Garvey, William D.Griffith, Belver C.	</author>

		   Scientific disciplines can be regarded as social devices which have, as one
		function, the analysis and reduction of raw information to assimilated 
		knowledge of a type which can be transmitted through professional training..
		Data on information flow in psychology reveal feedback to scientific workers
		and result in refinements of the product of research; later disseminations are 
		interwoven with processes of evaluation and selection and are directed toward 
		the creation of an integrated and tested body of knowledge.. The reported data 
		finish an empirical base for Ziman's consensual model of science and illuminate 
		difficulties which have arisen in the design and implementation of information 
		systems..
