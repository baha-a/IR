		   Index entries from the subject indexes to CA can, in general, be converted
		to 'normal' or title-like phrases by applying simple tests to the positions of
		prepositions and conjunctions in the entries.. Other, more complex, entries can
		be transformed after somewhat deeper analysis.. These manipulations are a 
		necessary preliminary step to the use of the subject-index language in 
		retrieval..A scheme is outlined for automatically compiling and editing subject 
		indexes by transforming descriptive phrases with regular structure and 
		vocabulary.. These transformations, based on the formal structure of language, 
		are shown to be admirably suited to computer manipulation..
