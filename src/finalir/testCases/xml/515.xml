	<title>A Journal Selection Model and Its Implications for a Library System	</title>
	<author>Kraft, D. H.Hill, T. W. Jr.	</author>
	<text>
		   The problem of selecting which journals to acquire in order to best satisfy 
		library objectives is modeled as a zero-one linear programming problem and 
		examined in detail.. The model incorporates an objective function based on 
		expected usage as a measure of journal worth and cost constraints which 
		account for the scarcity of capital.. The model can be used to aid the 
		librarian in making better selection decisions, since the objective function 
		can be shown to reflect the evaluation of the library as an information 
		retrieval system and as a service organization.. Moreover, the model of seen to 
		be related to inventory problems and scheduling models in industrial 
		operations.. 
		   Journal usage is discussed as a measure of journal worth and is contrasted 
		to journal productivity.. Constraints are considered for scarce resources other 
		than capital and for journal interrelationships..
