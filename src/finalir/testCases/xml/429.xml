	<title>The Information Content of Titles in Engineering Literature	</title>

		   Since many alerting and information services rely very heavily on the use
		of titles to transfer information to the potential user, it is essential that 
		he be aware of the proportion of the information contained in the complete
		document which will not be deducible from the title and which he will therefore
		miss.. Methods will be discussed for analyzing the relative information content
		of the titles of engineering paper and results presented for the amount and 
		type of information lost through scanning title listing only..
		   Between one-third and one-half of indexable terms are not retrievable from
		article titles even if all possible synonyms and  related terms are used.. If
		all synonyms are used instead of one keyword the amount of information 
		retrieved is increased by about 70 percent.. The problems of dealing with
		synonyms and with syntactical variants in searching titles indexes are 
		discussed.. The possibility of using keywords in journal titles as 
		supplementary retrieval tags is suggested since they were deemed useful in
		nearly one-third of the sample of papers analyzed..
