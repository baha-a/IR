	<text>
		   The purpose of this paper is to offer a solution to the problems of 
		documentation and bibliographic control of machine-readable data files.. It is a
		solution which attempts to meet both the needs of the data user and the data
		librarian.. It is design to make readily feasible the conversion completely or 
		in part to a computer-based operation and to tie in directly to an information 
		retrieval system in the future.. The four elements of this documentation and 
		control system are:standard catalogue entries, data abstract and data description
		forms, content documentation codebooks, and records of physical and logical 
		characteristics of the data set..
