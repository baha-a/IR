		  When it was decided that Cognitive Psychology would not specify
		size limits for articles, and that we would publish relevant papers in
		artificial intelligence, we hardly anticipated devoting an entire issue to a
		single piece of work.  However, Winograd's "Program for Understanding
		Natural Language" seems sufficiently general and important in its
		implications to warrant the experiment.  Some readers will find sufficient
		the first two sections, which present, respectively, an overview of the
		system and what it does, and a first-rate evaluation of research in artificial
		intelligence on natural language processing, semantics, and theorem proving.
		Others will want to explore in detail the structure of the syntactic
		component, the treatment of semantics, and the programming language
		for specifying theories of problem solving.  Each of these contributions
		is significant in its own right.  Together they form a unique, integrated
		system capable of parsing, interpreting, and acting upon the information
		contained in complex natural language discourse.
