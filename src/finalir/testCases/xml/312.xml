		  In the present edition we have, to a far greater extent, integrated diffusion
		research with the scientific study of human communication.  Diffusion
		researchers have long been aware that they were investigating a special type
		of communication behavior.  In this book we stress communication concepts
		and frameworks in our analysis of the diffusion process.  We feel this provides
		an advantage of conceptual clarity as well as ease of wide expression.  Our
		adoption of the communication viewpoint is reflected in the addition of
		several chapters, the complete reorganization of all chapters, and the frequent
		inclusion of new concepts.
