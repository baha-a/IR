	<title>Language and Mind	</title>

		  The three chapters of this book are somewhat elaborated versions of
		three lectures, the Beckman lectures, that I delivered at the University
		of California, at Berkeley, in January 1967.  The first is an attempt to
		evaluate past contributions to the study of mind that have been been based
		on research and speculation regarding the nature of language.  The second is
		devoted to contemporary developments in linguistics that have a bearing on
		the study of the mind.  The third is a highly speculative discussion of
		directions that the study of language and mind might take in coming years.
		The three lectures, then, are concerned with the past, the present, and
		the future.
