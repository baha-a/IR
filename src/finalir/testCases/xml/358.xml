	<title>The Disadvantaged and Library Effectiveness	</title>

		    The report is concerned with the social utility of libraries and
		with the factors that appear to be requirements for effective
		programs.  In the absence of established standards or criteria for
		measuring program effectiveness, we have substituted a comparative analysis of
		a number of programs based on detailed observation of the program process;
		a survey of needs and interests of the
		target groups, both users and nonusers; and an assessment of the
		library's role in the target neighborhood as it is perceived by other
		community institutions serving the same groups.  Thus a basis for
		comparisons and for judgements has been introduced which provides
		a foundation for suggestions as to the direction in which programs
		of service to the disadvantaged might move.
		  To achieve the study objectives, library programs and practices
		in low-income neighborhoods were examined in a number of cities.
		In each of fifteen cities data were collected through interview and
		observation in four subject areas: (1) the needs and interests of
		the community residents, (2) library services in relation to other
		available community resources, (3) the nature and scope of the
		neighborhood library program and its relation to the rest of the
		library system, and (4) available measures of the impact or
		effectiveness of the program.
