		  The four years since the first edition of this book was published have been a
		period of exceptional advance in the usage of computers in libraries.  Where
		one or two examples were all that were available at that time to illustrate
		each kind of application, now there are five to ten; where the cadre of
		knowledgeable people in libraries at that time was small, now virtually
		every major library has some kind of systems department; where the efforts at
		that time were largely experimental and developmental, now there is a wealth.
		This second edition has therefore been written in a context totally different
		from that of the first.
		  But its aims are the same; to ensure that practicing librarians and that
		students in library schools approach the world of automation with knowledge
		of its capabilities and limitations and with the techniques of systems
		analysis by which to analyze and evaluate alternative answers to the library's
		processing problems.  The changes from the first edition therefore represent
		not a departure from that purpose but simply an updating of its content, to
		reflect the advances and experience gained, and an opportunity to correct
		the errors (hopefully minor) that have been found through use of the first
		edition.
