	<title>Distance between Sets as an Objective Measure of Retrieval Effectiveness	</title>

	<text>
		   A general measure of retrieval effectiveness having full metric properties 
		and treating the "retrieval system - arbiter of relevance"situation 
		symmetrically, is the Marczewski-Steinhaus metric, D, measuring the distance 
		between the set of relevant documents, A, and set of retrieved documents, B, 
		according to D = 1 -(n (A ^ B)/n(A u B)).. D can be expressed as a function of 
		Presicion and Recall, or of Generality, Fallout and Recall, and of other sets 
		of traditional measures.. Acceptance of the measure allows criteria for 
		retrieval optimality and degeneracy to be stated, defined by minimum and 
		constant  values of D respectively.. Precision_Recall degeneracy curves for D 
		are given and compared with those for another general measure: the probability
		that a document will be correctly identified by a retrieval system.. 
		Statistical extensions of D are examined, and these and other properties of the
		metric are illustrated with seven examples..
