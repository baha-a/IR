		  Elsewhere (1) a survey has been reported of the use of the serials in the
		Science Museum Library.  In brief this showed that where the Science
		Museum Library's copy of a serial was frequently used, this serial was widely
		held, and that the converse was true.  In fact it appears that the use of the
		Science Museum's copy of a periodical is a rough measure of the national
		loan use of library copies.
