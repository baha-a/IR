		  This book was started during the years 1935-1936 and was
		intended to be a systematic psychology of the older type.  My
		effort was to synthesize the holistic, the dynamic and the cultural
		emphases which, each one, excited so many young psychologists
		of the time.  I felt that they were intrinsically related to each
		other, and that they were subaspects of a single, larger, encompassing
		whole.  I felt also that they would make more meaningful my
		previous studies at the University of Wisconsin in comparative
		and experimental psychology, and in biology and neurophysiology.
		Furthermore, I felt that they would enable me to serve better
		my humanistic aims.
