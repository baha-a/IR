	<title>Retrieval of Single Entries from a Computerized Library Catalog File	</title>
	<author>Kilgour, F.G.	</author>
	<text>
		        The major intellectual challenges confronting an architect of a total
		computerized library system is organization of a efficient file of millions of
		bibliographic references from which a single entry can be retrieved swiftly
		and uniquely.  Research on file organization has concentrated on retrieval of 
		multiple entries possessing some equal or similar characteristic.  However, a
		basic library bibliographic file should be organized to yield a record unequal
		and dissimilar to all others.  Such a file is analogous to the familiar main
		entry catalog, which every library maintains, and would have associated with
		it supplementary index files of subjects, titles, call numbers, and perhaps 
		other attributes.
