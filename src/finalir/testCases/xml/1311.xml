	<title>Is a Scientific Revolution Taking Place in Psychology? - Doubts and Reservations	</title>
	<author>Warren, N.	</author>

		  We were introduced by Kuhn to the notion of scientific progress as a series
		of qualitative changes, each involving the overthrow of a prevailing paradigm
		of thought by a new paradigm which alters the whole perspective of a science.
		Palermo has appropriately summarized Kuhn's analysis.  It seems, if we judge
		by constant citations of Kuhn and the references to paradigms, crises and
		revolutions among scientists and philosophers, that he has induced a novel
		self-consciousness about the growth of scientific knowledge and the nature of
		cumulativeness in the expansion of understanding - and not least among
		psychologists.  This may be in small part (though I doubt it) because one of
		psychology's concerns is the empirical study of the growth of knowledge: Jean
		Piaget, whose influence in some quarters has now become so great that he
		is hailed as a revolutionary in those quarters, has for several decades been
		developing a theory of the growth of knowledge - or, if you insist, of the
		development of cognition - which, like Kuhn's account (in his preface Kuhn
		acknowledges illumination from Piaget), eschews accumulation and posits a
		sequence of qualitative changes each of which completely reorganizes thinking.
