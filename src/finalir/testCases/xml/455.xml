		   A fuzzy set is a class of objects with a continuum of grades of membership..
		Such a set is characterized by a membership (characteristic) function which 
		assigns to each object a grade of membership ranging between zero and one.. The
		notions of inclusion, union, intersection, complement, relation, convexity, 
		etc., are extended to such sets, and various properties of these notions in the
		context of fuzzy sets are established.. In particular, a separation theorem for
		convex fuzzy sets is proved without requiring that the fuzzy sets be disjoint..
