	<title>The Use of Hierarchic Clustering in Information Retrieval	</title>
	<author>Jardine, N.Van Rijsbergen, C. J.	</author>
	<text>
		   We introduce information retrieval strategies which are based on automatic
		hierarchic clustering of documents.. We discuss the evaluation of retrieval
		strategies and show, using a subset of the Cranfield Aeronautics document 
		collection, that cluster-based retrieval strategies can be devised which are as 
		effective as linear associative retrieval strategies and much more efficient..
		Finally, we outline how cluster-based retrieval may be extended to large growing
		document collections and indicate some ways in which the effectiveness of
		cluster-based retrieval strategies may be improved..
