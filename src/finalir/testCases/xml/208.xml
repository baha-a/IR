		   A standardized procedure was developed for eliciting those details for a
		library's service policies that are important to its users and for recording
		the data by checking appropriate categories on a form.. This inventory 
		procedure covers the entire spectrum of user services and accommodates a wide
		range of policies.. The inventory was originally designed for use by trained
		interviewers in large-scale surveys of academic medical libraries.. However,
		it is also suitable for other kinds of libraries, and the Interview Guide and
		Checklist can be used for a self-survey by library stuff.. In addition to 
		survey use, the inventory has a variety of educational, administrative,
		managerial, and research applications.. A methods for weighting the categorical
		inventory data to reflect the relative desirability of different policies makes 
		it possible to calculate scores indicating how a library's policies compare
		with those of an "optimal" library.. An analogous inventory of the services a 
		library provides to other libraries was developed for surveying major backup
		resources in the medical library system..
