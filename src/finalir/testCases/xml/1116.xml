	<text>
		   Postulating an interrelation between semantic and pragmatic properties of 
		scientific information, the author formulates the information value function
		as depending on three arguments:  subject, information, and purpose; thus, this 
		value is a composite of subjective and objective factors..  Possible 
		classifications scientific information values are discussed.. A methodological
		analysis of three approaches to the mathematical notion of information value is
		given and, by analogy, some propositions concerning measurement of scientific
		information value are expressed..
