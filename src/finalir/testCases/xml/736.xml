		  In 1971 the Committee on Chemical Information of the
		National Academy of Sciences, National Research Council,
		recognized the problem of large data bases and accordingly
		created a subcommittee to investigate the problem and its
		impact on chemical information.
		  The first task of the Large Data Base Subcommittee was
		to survey organizations that generate and/or process large
		data bases.  Giering has indicated several different ways in
		which one can view a data base as being large.  It can be
		large in terms of having a large number of entries or
		records (or bibliographic references).  It can be large in
		the sense of having a large number of fields or data
		elements, which implies a degree of complexity.  It can be
		thought of as large in the sense of having a large number
		of searchable or selectable elements, and it also can be
		large in the most readily understandable sense of having
		a large number of characters in storage.
