	<title>Interlibrary Loan Involving Academic Libraries	</title>

		  Interlibrary loan transactions involving academic libraries in the United
		States numbered over 800,000 items in 1963-64.  This number is growing
		exponentially.  Large libraries report that they cannot fill about a third
		of the interlibrary loan requests they receive.  Unfilled interlibrary loans
		are costly to both the borrowing and the lending libraries and reduce the
		usefulness of the service to the reader.  Many of these interlibrary loan
		failures are preventable, chiefly by publishing policies of the lending
		libraries to prevent borrowers from requesting noncirculating materials and
		by determining in advance what library owns the item wanted.
