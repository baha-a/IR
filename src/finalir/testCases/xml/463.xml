	<title>Information Retrieval; British and American, 1876-1976	</title>
	<author>Metcalfe, J.	</author>
	<text>
		        Of eight chapters this first one deals with principles and
		definitions and then with the slow development of information
		retrieval through about 5,000 years until the introduction of
		printing in Europe less than 500 years prior to our period
		of principal coverage, 1876-1976.  This latter period coincides
		with the second century of the United States of America,
		during which were intensified earlier efforts to carry out one of
		Washington's urgings in his Farewell Address:  "Promote
		then, as an object of primary importance, institutions for the general diffusion
		of knowledge."
