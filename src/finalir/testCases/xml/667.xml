	<title>A Mathematical Method for Analyzing the Growth of a Scientific Discipline	</title>

		  The spread of ideas within a scientific community and the spread of infectious
		disease are both special cases of a general communication process.  Thus a
		general theory of epidemics can explain the growth of symbolic logic from 1847
		to 1962.  An epidemic model predicts the rise and fall of particular research 
		areas within symbolic logic.  A Markov chain model of individual movement 
		between research areas indicates that once an individual leaves an area he is
		not expected to return.
		  KEY WORDS AND PHRASES:  epidemic model, epidemic process, theory of epidemics,
		growth of literature, history of symbolic logic, epidemiology of symbolic logic,
		epidemic curve, stochastic models, Markov chains.
