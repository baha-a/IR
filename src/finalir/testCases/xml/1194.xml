	<title>Compaction of Names by X-grams	</title>
	<author>Walker, Verdon R.	</author>
	<text>
		   This paper presents a method for compacting proper given names for computer
		storage.. The method presented uses x-grams which are combinations of from one
		to eight letters.. Rather than spelling names letter by letter, they are 
		"spelled" with x-grams..
		   An algorithm as been implemented in a computer program and used to obtain
		sets of x-grams for two large (42,165 and 43,875) given name samples.. Using
		the x-grams obtained, it was possible to represent the names from one sample in
		1.78 bits per original character and in 2.1 bits per original character in the
		second sample..
