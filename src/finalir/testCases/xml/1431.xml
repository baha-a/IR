		  A new step towards international co-operation
		in scientific and technical information. 
		  The agencies specializing in documentation of documentation (i.e., handling
		the literature on scientific and technical information) are in turn having
		problems with the growth of information.  The number of their centres has 
		been growing during the last few years - often several in a country and all
		with activities that are often very similar; scanning and abstracting of
		documents from the same sources, indexing jobs that may differ only in
		practical details, more or less identical end-products (descriptive
		bibliographies, abstracting bulletins, indexes, selective distribution
		programmes, card-indexes, and so on).
