	<title>Technology; economic growth and public policy	</title>
	<author>Nelson, R.R.	</author>
	<text>
		  This book explores the relations among research, development, innovation,
		and economic growth; considers the manner in which the economy adapts to
		technical change and the problems encountered in the processes of adaption;
		and recommends several policy changes designed to encourage technological
		change consistent with other public policy objectives.  Since they address
		policy makers as well as scholars, the authors have tried to avoid scholarly
		jargon without sacrificing scholarly rigor.
