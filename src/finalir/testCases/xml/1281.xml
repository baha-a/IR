		  Abstract.  Individuals who received documents
		through a selective dissemination of information
		system were asked to determine the relevance of
		documents to their work interests on the basis of 
		titles and of abstracts.  The results indicate
		that there was no significant difference between
		the usefulness of titles and of abstracts for this
		purpose.
