	<text>
		   A project was undertaken to discover the major determinants of the costs of 
		searching, on-line, on a practical reference retrieval system (SCISEARCH).. The
		methodology and some results of this project are reported.. Controlled searches
		were undertaken to isolate the effect of each of a number of variables.. A 
		model involving several of the major variables was then developed.. The general
		approach proved to be (in this case) both feasible and useful..
