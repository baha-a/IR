	<title>"Early Warning" Generic Medium Designations in Multimedia Catalogues	</title>
	<author>Lewis, Peter R.	</author>

		 The much-favored "early warning" generic medium designation is discriminatory,
		functionally inefficient, and out of line with the national and international
		acceptance of AACR.. A specific designation, placed with the collation, is
		preferable on all these grounds; and there are better ways of giving an "early
		warning"..
