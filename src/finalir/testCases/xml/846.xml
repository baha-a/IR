	<title>Jesse Shera and the Theory of Bibliography	</title>

		  Twenty years ago Jesse Shera suggested that there was a need for a more
		analytical study of bibliography which might help to bridge library and
		information services.  Little note was taken of this proposal at the time
		but developments have since occurred and are here briefly reported.  It is
		argued that Shera's "macrobibliography" or "social epistemology" provides
		not only a subject for theoretical study but that it will also be needed
		for the rational design of library and information systems and networks of
		the near future.
