		  This work is a contribution to the literature of librarianship and
		some parts of it may interest a wider audience.  The chapters consist
		of a series of introductory explorations into several related fields.
		Some of these areas are usually included in curricula for library
		studies programmes, under a title such as "The library and the
		community" or "The social background to libraries."
