		  This paper presents a conceptualization of information as related to the
		decision problems of the recipient.  The orientation is toward a formal
		definition of behavioral elements in an individual's "purposeful state":
		specifically, these elements are his objectives, his valuation of each
		objective, his possible courses of action, the efficiency of each course of
		action in achieving each objective, and his probability of choice for each
		course of action.
		  The amount of information in a purposeful state is explicitly defined in
		terms of the probabilities of choice of the available courses of action.
		The amount of information in a message is defined as the difference between the
		amount of information in the purposeful state following the message, and the
		amount of information in the purposeful state preceding the message.  The amount
		of instruction in a purposeful state is defined in terms of the efficiencies
		of the available courses of action; and the amount of motivation is defined in
		terms of the values of the objectives.	The amounts of instruction and 
		motivation in a message are defined, just as information is, by comparing the
		amounts in a purposeful state before and after receipt of the message.
		  The value of a purposeful state to an individual is defined as a function of
		the amount of information, the amount of instruction, and the amount of
		motivation in the state.  This concept can be generalized to express the value
		of the state to some other individual.
