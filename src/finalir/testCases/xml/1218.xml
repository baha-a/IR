		  It is the purpose of this book to present a firm theoretical basis for
		numerical taxonomy, to show why we believe numerical taxonomy has
		advantages over conventionally practiced taxonomy, to report on the
		previous advances made in the field so far, and to furnish newcomers in
		the field with a detailed step-by-step description of the procedures
		employed in numerical taxonomy.
