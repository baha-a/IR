		            The problems facing the planners of automated library
		networks are rooted in the complexities of organizing and managing
		a vast flow of bibliographic information and its interface with
		users.  Telecommunication equipment transmitting data in the form
		of electric signals, electronic memories holding large stores of
		information, and computers manipulating the data and graphic displays
		for human interaction are technological means for performing network
		functions more effectively than has been possible in the past.
