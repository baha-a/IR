	<title>Operations Research:  Implications for Libraries	</title>

		  Library operations in recent times have been characterized by a great
		increase in complexity.  The rapid expansion of collections, both in size
		and scope, the great variety of forms taken by items that now must be housed
		in the library, and the growth in expectations among library users are
		among the factors that have contributed to this complexity.  In this setting,
		managerial decision making in the library has become an unenviably difficult 
		task. Furthermore, the new technologies and new techniques which offer great
		opportunities for library planners and  managers make even more difficult the 
		use of traditional, intuitive approaches.  It is reasonable to ask whether 
		techniques such as Operations Research (O. R.) that have proved valuable in 
		similar situations for business and government, might not also be of service 
		in libraries.
