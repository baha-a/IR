	<text>
		  This study is an attempt to submit to a critical analysis the
		main problems related to corporate headings, the difficulties
		raised by them and the solutions which now prevail in various
		countries.
		  In order to make the differences existing between the various
		solutions and the unsatisfactory character revealed by many of
		them more evident, a great number of examples in a variety of
		languages, extracted from cataloguing codes, national bibliographies, 
		printed lists of corporate headings have been added.  These examples
		are also intended to draw attention to differences existing with
		regard to various technical details, such as punctuation, 
		capitalization, transliteration, etc.
		  In addition, many of these examples will clearly prove that
		certain solutions which may be considered to be suitable for one
		country or one language would not satisfy the requirements of
		another country or another language.
		  In the study, examination and analysis of codes has been 
		complemented by references to professional literature on the subject
		available to the author, and by an analysis of opinions expressed
		there.  Special attention has been paid to comparisons of cataloguing
		practices and citation usages, and to investigations of the users'
		approach to corporate headings.  It is well understood and appreciated
		that, for the catalogue user, the identification of and search for
		corporate headings present more problems than any other type of
		heading.  Unfortunately, however, professional literature has as
		yet paid insufficient attention to these problems.
