		  The development of a current awareness system in The Dow Chemical Company 
		has resulted in four established services, one based on internal information and
		the other three on Chemical Abstracts.  In addition several other services are 
		now being tried or considered.  The operation of such a service is expensive, 
		but the willingness of the user to pay for it and responses to a survey indicate
		that it is a useful and worthwhile tool to the scientist and engineer.  The
		use of such services also has a significant effect on other established
		information services.
