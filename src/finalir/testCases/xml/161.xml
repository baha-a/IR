	<title>User Studies:  A Review of the Literature from 1966 to 1970	</title>

		  My terms of reference when asked to prepare this review of user studies were
		to bring Fishenden's work up to date.  This was published in the Journal of 
		Documentation in September 1965 and in his paper he looks at a limited number
		of British use studies and draws some broad general conclusions relating to the
		development of a national information service.  The present paper which covers
		the literature back to the beginning of 1966 is somewhat more detailed.  It
		considers a wide range of investigations into the information gathering habits 
		of scientists, engineers, social scientists and others, and reports results 
		which it is hoped will provide managers with information on which to develop
		policies regarding library and information services at all levels.  Although
		an increasing number of studies is being carried out in Eastern Europe and
		in the USSR there has been no major work reported and consequently the review
		considers mainly British and American investigations.
