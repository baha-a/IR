		  The mathematical theory of measurement is used to construct a framework
		for the evaluation of information retrieval strategies.  The model arrived at
		is based on precision and recall.  After a detailed examination of the kind of
		conditions the model can be expected to satisfy a plausible measure of
		effectiveness is derived.  Finally, a number of other measures are shown to be
		special cases of it.
