		   The output of scientific literature has been increasing exponentially since
		the second quarter of this century.. New journals in specialized branches of 
		science keep appearing and established periodicals either multiply the number of 
		volumes per year or split into different titles covering narrower subject 
		areas in order to cope with the flow of communications received for 
		publication.. The limited resources or libraries, particularly in the 
		developing countries, do not permit them to increase library space or budget at
		a rate commensurate with this rise in publication.. Consequently research 
		libraries in such countries as India must be highly selective in their
		acquisition programmes and to do so without detriment to the research interests
		of the institution they serve, they urgently need dependable data on the ranking 
		of periodicals according to the particular research needs of their respective 
		countries.. In this article an attempt is made to rank periodicals in the field
		of the biomedical sciences, from the point of view of the Indian scientist..
		This method may also be followed in the libraries of other developing countries 
		by changing the citing journals according to their country's needs..
