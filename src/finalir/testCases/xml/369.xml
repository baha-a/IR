		  The purpose of this book is to explain a way of looking at military
		problems which we and others with whom we have been associated have
		found fruitful in insights and productive of solutions.  Essentially we
		regard all military problems as, in one of their aspects, economic
		problems in the efficient allocation and use of resources.  We believe
		that this way of looking at military problems goes far toward reconciling
		the apparent conflict of views between the officers and officials who are
		responsible for defense and the officials and Congressmen whose primary
		interest is economy - except in determining the over-all size of the
		military budget, where conflict between these points of view is inevitable.
