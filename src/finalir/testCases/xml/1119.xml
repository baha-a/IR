		   Sets are considered on which a symmetric and reflexive relation, called
		tolerance (similarity) is defined..
		   The structure of such sets is explored.. 
		   A classificatory theorem is proved stating an isomorphism of embedding of
		such sets in a model space (R)..
		   The properties of particular sets' for which the similarity relation has 
		been defined are investigated..
