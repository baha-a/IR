		    This book might be considered a conceptual inventory.  This is a
		departure from the recent fashion of conducting "propositional
		inventories," which assumes that important relationships have already been
		explored (Berelson and Steiner, 1964).  I assume merely that the concepts
		relevant to important relationships exist, and once having identified some,
		I hope to generate potentially significant propositions.  We lack the
		systematic evidence that eventually must come, but there are illustrative
		studies cited to indicate that the propositions which are neither time- nor
		space-bound.
		    I assume that there are differences among organizations, and hope
		to account for some of them.  But I also assume that there is not a one-
		to-one correspondence between significant organizational differences and
		the typical categories of business, government, medicine, and education.
		Likewise, I believe there is not a direct correlation between the academic
		disciplines and useful categories of complex organizations.
