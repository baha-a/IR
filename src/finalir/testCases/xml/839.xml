		  Development in university libraries in recent years in reader services,
		instruction in library use and subject specialization go only a small way
		to meeting the problems created by the "information explosion."  Reasons
		why more dynamic and personal information services for scientists and
		social scientists should be developed include the limitations in researchers'
		present use of libraries and information, the preference of users for informal
		channels of communication, increasing pressures on the time of university
		teachers, and problems associated with computer retrieval systems.  Specialist
		posts of information officer should be created as part of the library services,
		but with functions distinct from those of the librarian; difficulties that
		may arise with their location and operation are discussed.  The cost of
		information services in depth is heavy, but it may be possible to develop
		them within the existing budget by a reallocation of funds and staff duties.
