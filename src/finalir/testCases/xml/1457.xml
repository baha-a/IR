	<title>World Trends in Library Education	</title>

		  One of the most significant aspects of the evolution of
		librarianship in the twentieth century has been the emergence 
		of the library schools as a potent factor in shaping new
		philosophies and new attitudes in the library profession.  The
		intention of the present work is to examine some of the
		implications of this rapid growth in the number of library
		schools, noting current trends and possible changes in the
		future.  Inevitably, some limitations have had to be imposed,
		and there has been a deliberate concentration upon Anglo-
		American library education, while at the same time examining
		other major patterns of professional education for librarians
		which exist in the world, and comparing these with the
		approach  of the English speaking countries.  An attempt has
		been made to trace the influences which the British and
		America systems of library education have had, particularly
		in the developing countries.
