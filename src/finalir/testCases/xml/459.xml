	<title>Information Retrieval On-Line	</title>

	<text>
		    This book deals with on-line systems for bibliographic search and
		retrieval.  The literature on this subject is increasing rapidly and new systems
		are appearing all the time.  We have attempted to provide a broad survey of
		the characteristics, capabilities, and limitations of present systems.  Our
		emphasis is on the design, evaluation, and use of on-line retrieval systems,
		primarily from the viewpoint of the planner and manager of information
		services.  It is oriented toward the "intellectual" aspects of information
		retrieval rather than the hardware or programming aspects.  We hope that
		this book may have some value for all students of library and information
		science.
