		  The Terminology of Documentation is intended to help standardize basic
		terminology in the rapidly developing field of documentation and thus to
		foster international co-operation. It should also be useful as a reference 
		work for organizations and individuals working in the fields of documentation,
		libraries and information processing, to translators and to students in these
		fields.
