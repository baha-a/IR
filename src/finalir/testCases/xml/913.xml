		  Although catalogue codes and standards have received much attention, there 
		has been very little fundamental questioning of cataloguing principles and 
		practice.  Basic questions in need of investigation include: whether individual 
		libraries need catalogues of their own stock; how far printed  bibliographies
		could serve as a substitute; the functions catalogues are serving at present, 
		and the actual demands placed on them; the nature of users and non-users, and 
		the possible conflicts between the catalogue needs of librarians and 
		non-librarians; the psychological factors of approachability and usability; 
		whether standardization should over-rule local needs; whether catalogues
		should be designed for use by readers at all; the functions of printed national 
		catalogues; the implications of increased co-operation and of the changing 
		functions of libraries; what a catalogue entry should contain and how it
		should be arranged; and the possible administrative uses of catalogue data.  
		Mechanization has made these questions of great urgency.
