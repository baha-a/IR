		        Our report on the analysis of social structure in the Monteith
		Library Project begins with discussion of certain general characteristics
		of research of this type and with comments on the academic institution
		as a specific type of formal organization.  We turn next to a consideration
		of particular social science concepts found useful in bringing into focus
		significant features of the Monteith structure.  Finally, we discuss the
		effect of these Monteith structural features upon the library project at
		each stage of its development.
