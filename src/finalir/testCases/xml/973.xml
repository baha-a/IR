	<title>The Divided Catalog: A Summary of the Literature	</title>
	<author>Grosser, D.	</author>

		  In the earliest item (1905) in the bibliography here presented, Fletcher
		challenges the right of the dictionary catalog to be the overwhelmingly
		predominant type of catalog in libraries.  He questions its advocates' claim
		that it best meets a library's needs.  He advocates a divided catalog such as
		the one at Amherst because, for one thing, the separate catalog
		can more readily be used in conjunction with bibliographies in the subject
		fields.  We find a similar argument in the latest item in the bibliography
		(Harris, 1957).  Fletcher's article seems to have been followed by more
		than thirty years of silence in the library journals on the subject
		of the divided catalog.  During that period there were probably some
		divisions of catalogs at some libraries but, as Thom (q.v.) indicates, the
		greatest period of such activity started in 1937.  Our survey of the
		literature on the divided catalog corroborates this since 1938 in the year
		in which the steady stream of papers on the subject began.
