	<title>Vocabulary Control for Information Retrieval	</title>
	<author>Lancaster, F.W.	</author>
	<text>
		  This book deals with properties of vocabularies for
		indexing and searching document collections; the
		construction, organization, display, and maintenance
		of these vocabularies; and the vocabulary as a factor
		affecting the performance of retrieval systems.  Most
		of the text is concerned with vocabularies for post-
		coordinate retrieval systems, with special emphasis
		on thesauri and machine-based systems.  Vocabularies
		for pre-coordinate systems (e.g., alphabetical subject
		catalogs and classified catalogs) are discussed only
		briefly to provide historical perspective and for the
		light they shed on the problems o vocabulary control in
		general.  This type of vocabulary is well covered in
		existing texts.
