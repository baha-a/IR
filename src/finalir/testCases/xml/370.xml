		  Educating the Library User is a collection of original essays, case
		studies, and research reports on the problems, hopes, and techniques of 
		instructing library users and nonusers, from the kindergartener to the 
		preschool adult, in the effective use of libraries and their resources.
		Merging the library-use teachings of school, public, and academic
		libraries, this book demonstrates the need for a consistent, sequential
		plan of library-use instruction that crosses traditional library boundaries.
