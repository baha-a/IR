	<title>A Correlative Notation System for NMR Data	</title>
	<author>Skolnik, Herman	</author>
	<text>
		   A new linear notation system which denotes carbon in terms of bounds and 
		attached hydrogen(s) is used to correlate proton groups in organic molecules
		with chemical shifts.. The notation system is illustrated with acyclic and
		cyclic examples, and the production of tables of NMR data via computer by 
		proton group vis-a-vis neighboring groups is demonstrated.. Tables of chemical
		shifts in ascending order is a valuable by-product of the computerized system..
