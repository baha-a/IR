		  This volume is an edited collection of some papers from the 1963
		Symposium on Library Functions in the Changing Metropolis
		sponsored by the Joint Center for Urban Studies and the National 
		Book Committee.  Not all the papers delivered at the Symposium are
		included, and papers by Banfield, Blasingame, and myself were written
		especially for this volume.  The authors are urban social scientists,
		economists, historians, sociologists, political scientists, planners,
		communication experts, library scholars, and library administrators.
		The papers are about libraries and cities, and their main purpose is
		to raise issues about the character of cities and the future of libraries
		whose milieu is the city.
