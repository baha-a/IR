		  This paper develops a conception of ways in which certain psychosocial
		processes affect the allocation of rewards to scientists for their 
		contributions - an allocation which in turn affects the flow of ideas and
		findings through the communication networks of science.  The conception
		is based upon an analysis of the composite of experience reported
		in Harriet Zuckerman's interviews with Nobel laureates in the United
		States (1) and upon data drawn from the diaries, letters, notebooks,
		scientific papers, and biographies of other scientists.
