	<title>Computer Generation of Wiswesser Line Notation.II. Polyfused, Perifused, and Chained Ring Structure	</title>

		   The computer program for the generation of Weswesser Line Notation (WLN) has
		been extended to include polyfused rings, methyl contraction rules, chain of 
		two ring systems, some perifused rings, some chelates, and some metallocences..
		Salts and ions are also handled, but in a different manner than what is normally
		found.. Multipliers are not used by the program.. The normal input for the WLN
		generation is an easy input program using a Rand Tablet; however, teletype and 
		connection table input can also be used in most cases..
