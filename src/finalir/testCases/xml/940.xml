		  A proper understanding of the International Standard Bibliographic
		Description (ISBD), a standard promulgated by the International Federation of
		Library Associations (IFLA), requires some knowledge of how it came into
		existence, what reasoning prompted its development, ad what useful results can 
		be expected from its adoption.  These matters will be dealt with below,
		hopefully in sufficient detail to provide readers with a basis for teaching a 
		sound evaluation of the effect of this standard when applied to American 
		cataloging practice and in particular to LC cataloging and MARC tapes.
