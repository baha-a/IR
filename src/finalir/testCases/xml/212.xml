		   This paper describes the construction of a synonym thesaurus or entry 
		vocabulary for the SUNY Biomedical Communication Network, which will permit
		the user greater ease of access to MeSH-indexed material without previously
		consulting a printed list of indexed terms.. In order to discover the actual
		terminalogy used by a researcher, words were extracted from titles of articles
		appearing in Index Medicus, and compared with the subject heading under which
		they appeared.. As well as strict synonyms, grammatical variants were also 
		included.. Work is continuing on relating other indexing vocabularies, such as
		Excerpta Medica and Current Medical Terminalogy, used in the biomedical world 
		to MeSH terms..
