		  This paper describes the key points that characterize
		CAS' approach to large scale scientific-technical information
		systems that must handle over 100,000 documents per year.
		The first of these points is the "single analysis/multiple
		use" concept.  Intellectual ability is a rare commodity 
		and essential to an information service.  Therefore, it makes
		sense to conserve that commodity and not use manpower to
		perform repetitive jobs or to waste effort analyzing information.
