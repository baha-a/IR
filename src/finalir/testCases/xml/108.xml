	<title>Productivity Differences among Scientists:  Evidence for Accumulative Advantage	</title>
	<author>Allison, Paul D.Stewart, John A	</author>
	<text>
		   The highly skewed distributions of productivity among scientists can be 
		partly explained by a process of accumulative advantage.. Because of feedback
		through recognition and resources, highly productive scientists maintain or
		increase their productivity, while scientists who produce very little produce
		even less later on.. A major implication of accumulative advantage is that the
		distribution of productivity becomes increasingly unequal as a cohort of
		scientists ages.. Cross-sectional survey data support this hypothesis for
		chemists, physicists, and mathematicians, who show strong linear increases in
		inequality with increasing career age.. This increase is highly associated with 
		a changing distribution of time spent on research.. Another implication of 
		accumulative advantage is also corroborated: the association among productivity,
		resources and esteem increases as career age increases..
