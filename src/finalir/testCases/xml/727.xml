		   Two statistical models for estimating search time have been developed for 
		the CA Condensates data base using the University of Georgia Text Search
		System.. Graphs showing the effect of data base size and number of search terms 
		on search time are presented.. Comparative timings between the Chemical
		Abstracts Service search program and the University of Georgia search program
		are made for the CA Condensates data base..
