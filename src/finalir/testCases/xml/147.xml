		  Since Bernal made his pilot survey of the use of scientific literature
		for the 1948 Royal Society Scientific Information Conference, at least
		three dozen other investigations have been reported of the needs of
		scientists and engineers for information, of their information gathering
		habits, and the use to which they put information.
		  Some of these have been concerned with the people in individual
		organizations, but have implications elsewhere.  Others, including
		Aslib's own investigations, have had wider aims.  Some have been
		based upon observations and records of what the scientists and
		engineers themselves did or said, and some upon records of the demands
		they made upon libraries.  There have been both surveys of opinions,
		and collections of facts.
