	<text>
		  The major purpose of this study is to describe, analyze,
		and evaluate the position of the public library in the structure
		of government in the United States.  The use of the word
		"government" in the title, therefore, is deliberate.  We are
		here concerned with the legal forms and types of governmental
		organization of the public library and with its relation to
		the city or other political unit to which it is attached or
		which it serves.
