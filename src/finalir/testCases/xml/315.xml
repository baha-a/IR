		documents and transmit their contents in automatic analysis: the relative-
		frequency approach to measuring the significance of words, word groups, and 
		sentences.. The relative-frequency approach is discussed in detail, as is its
		application to problems of automatic indexing and automatic abstracting.. 
		Included in the report is a summary of automatic analysis studies published as
		of the date of writing.. Conclusions are drawn that point toward more 
		sophisticated mathematical and linguistic techniques for the solution of 
		problems of automatic analysis..
