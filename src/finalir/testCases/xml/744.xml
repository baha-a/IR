		   Using an on-line literature searching system, the number of papers in many 
		journals dealing with semiconductors was determined.. The journals are ranked 
		by the percentage of their contents devoted to semiconductors, and by the total
		number of semiconductors papers are published.. Only four journals devote over
		half of their contents to semiconductors papers.. Approximately half of the
		19,646 papers (which were found in 91 journals) appeared in eight journals..
