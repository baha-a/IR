		  For several years we have thought that greater effort should be
		expended to create more understanding of the processes involved in
		information storage, retrieval, and dissemination.  Too often, concepts
		deriving from science and technology are made to seem unnecessarily
		abstruse, either inadvertently or deliberately to preserve some sort of
		mystique.  This book is intended to explicate, if not popularize, major
		aspects of I S and R processes as they are exemplified by the field of
		chemical documentation.  To the extent that this work is found useful
		by chemists, information specialists, and all individuals interested in
		scientific documentation, we shall be gratified.
