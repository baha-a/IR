		  Independently of the work as a cumulative index and
		thesaurus a study has been carried out about some information
		services in the field of documentation.  The aim was to
		obtain an overview of the writer's work in the documentation
		area, and at the same time to generate the references
		necessary for a survey about the "documentation of
		documentation."  Nine new information services were considered.
