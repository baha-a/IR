		    This book is intended as a reasonably comprehensive discussion
		of library automation systems for the librarian without previous
		knowledge or experience in the field, and for the intelligent layman.
		Library automation systems, in the context of this work, are 
		combinations of electronic data processing machines and appropriate
		programs and operating procedures, organized to work together in
		carrying out, with a minimum of human intervention, some well-defined
		library process.  It is a field that many thoughtful observers feel
		has reached a certain maturity, and so deserves to have its portrait
		made.
