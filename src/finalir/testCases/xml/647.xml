	<title>Optimal Resource Allocation in Library Systems	</title>
	<author>Rouse, William B.	</author>
	<text>
		   A procedure is developed for optimal allocation of resources among the many
		processes of a library system.. Queueing theory is used to model processes as
		either waiting or balking processes.. The optimal allocation of resources to 
		these processes is defined as that which maximizes the expected value of the
		decision-maker's utility function.. An application of the procedure to a 
		specific library system is discussed..
