		   Sets of objects possessing specified characteristics are studied.. The
		similarity and equivalence relations between objects are established and
		explored..
		   A canonical system of characteristics is derived.. Similarity and commonness 
		measures of the subsets of objects are investigated.. The implications of 
		those notions for the problem of retrieval classification are pointed out..
