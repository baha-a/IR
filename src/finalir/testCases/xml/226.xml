	<title>A Behavioral Approach to Historical Analysis	</title>
	<author>Berkhofer, R.F.	</author>
	<text>
		  To issue a clarion call for historians to adopt a behavioral
		approach to their subject may seem as up-to-date and exciting as
		last month's newspaper, for it is the academic fashion today to
		argue the utility of social science theory in the writing of
		history.  Books and articles issue forth from the presses in
		seeming profusion advocating and even occasionally demonstrating
		such an approach.  Yet these many pages fail in three significant
		ways to accomplish the end they nominally espouse and which I urge.
