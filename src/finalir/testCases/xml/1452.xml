	<title>The Wiswesser Line-Formula Chemical Notation (WLN)	</title>

	<text>
		    The line-formula chemical notation described in this manual
		is a precise and concise means of expressing the structural
		formulas of chemical compounds.  Its basic idea is to use
		letter symbols to denote functional groups and to use numbers
		to express the lengths of alkyl chains and the sizes of rings.
		These symbols then are cited in connecting order from one end of
		the molecule to the other.  For the past hundred years, ever
		since structural chemistry began, chemists have been using graphic
		symbols in this way.  This line-formula notation is simply an
		extension and standardization of this practice.
