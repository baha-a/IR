		  The operational performance over a 17-month period of the previously
		described selective dissemination system is presented.  Of the 21,000 
		notifications sent to about 20 users, 91% were evaluated; of these, 14%
		were of "Document-Ordered Interest," 48% were "Of Interest," 27% were
		"Marginal," and 11% were "Of No Interest."  Recall data obtained from
		about half the users over a period of eight months show the precision-
		factor/recall-factor products are generally greater than 0.5.  The
		effect of iterative profile adjustments on precision-recall performance
		is discussed.  A comparison made with four other SDI systems shows a
		relatively high level of performance for this system.
