	<text>
		   This study investigated various techniques for systematically abbreviating 
		English words and names.. Most of the attention was given to the techniques 
		which could be mechanized with a digital device such as a general purpose 
		digital computer.. Particular was paid to techniques that could process 
		incoming  information without prior knowledge of its existence (i.e., no table
		lookups).. Thirteen basic techniques and their modifications are described..
		In addition, most of the techniques were tested on a sample of several thousand
		subject words and several thousand proper names in order to provide a 
		quantitative measure of comparison..
