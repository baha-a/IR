		  The processing and transfer of information is an important activity of many
		thousands of libraries, research institutes, educational institutions,
		professional and trade associations, non-profit organizations, publishing
		houses, government agencies, and others.  All of these groups are already
		listed in a variety of existing directories.  This publication, on the other
		hand, has selected from the above groups, those organizations and services
		which are principally concerned with storage, retrieval, and dissemination
		of information, and in addition, are innovative, experimental, or non-
		conventional.  A major emphasis is on computerization, micrographics, networks,
		advanced reference services, information centers, and data banks.
		  The Encyclopedia of Information Systems and Services includes descriptions
		of the following types of services and facilities:
		        
		        Information Centers
		        Computerized Systems and Services
		        Networks and Cooperative Programs
		        Data Banks
