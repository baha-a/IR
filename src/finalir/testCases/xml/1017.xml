		            The evaluation of reference service has received
		considerable attention in the literature over a comparatively long
		period.  But, as Samuel Rothstein pointed out in his 1964 Library Trends
		article on the measurement and evaluation of reference service, much
		of the literature has focused on discussing the lack of evaluation or
		the shortcomings of the evaluation that has taken place.  In the ten years
		since Rothstein wrote his article, there does seem to be more effort at
		evaluation of reference service.  Undoubtedly, many of the trends in 
		recent evaluation are due to the influence of Rothstein's article.
