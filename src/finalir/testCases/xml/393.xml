	<title>Farewell to Alexandria Solution to space, growth, and performance problems of libraries	</title>
	<author>Gore, D.	</author>
	<text>
		  The publication of this collection of essays opens a new era for
		libraries, taking the first departure in 2,300 years from that durable
		model conceived by the librarians of Alexandria and endlessly replicated
		by every succeeding generation of librarians, right down to the present
		day.  The Alexandrian model persists through the unexamined faith
		that to be good a library must be vast and always growing.  The papers
		presented here examine that faith scientifically, demonstrate that it
		rests on nothing more solid than mistaken intuition, and consign it to
		the limbo of outworn dogmas.
