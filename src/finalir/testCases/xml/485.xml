	<author>Price, NancySchminovich, Samuel	</author>
	<text>
		   A document collection consisting of 240 articles on theoretical high energy
		physics is analyzed by an empirical clustering procedure, in which 
		bibliographic coupling, obtained by computer, is used to measure the 
		relatedness of articles.. Meaningful groups of documents were produced.. The 
		clustering process ia adapted to future use in the computer-generation of a 
		classification scheme..
