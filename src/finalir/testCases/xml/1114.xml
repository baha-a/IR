		   Parameters of information flows are identified as reflected in VINITI's
		abstract journals carrying materials in shipbuilding and the related fields..
		The objective of the large-scale analysis of these flows is to support the
		development of an automated system of ship design and the industry's sci-tech
		information subsystem..  More than 1400 periodicals and serials have been
		identified that are relevant to the field..  The file of secondary publications
		in the field carried by VINITI abstract journals since 1956 amounted to 185,000
		items..
