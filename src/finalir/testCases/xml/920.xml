		  The nature of serials is such that, in both the ALA Cataloging Rules for 
		Author and Titles Entries and the Anglo-American Cataloging Rules (AACR),there
		are special rules for choice of entry for serials that differ from the rules for 
		monographs.  While the Statement of Principles Adopted at the International
		Conference on Cataloging Principles (Paris Principles) leaves much room for 
		interpretation and controversy regarding serials, it also provides for special 
		rules for choice of entry.
