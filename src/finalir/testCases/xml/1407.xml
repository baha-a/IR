		   This is an empirical study of information transfer in the RandD operations of
		large industrial corporations.. Its basis is a body of survey data collected 
		from 2000 engineers and scientists in 13 establishments of four corporations
		and from 1200 members of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics 
		Engineers.. The data describe instances in which respondents acquired useful
		technical information from sources outside their immediate circle of 
		colleagues.. The analysis is descriptive in character, following a functional
		approach in which the use of various means of information transfer is 
		considered in relation to the purposes of technical work..
		   While the data, in general, confirm the results of other studies of this
		sort, they demonstrate also that the relative use of alternative means will
		vary significantly with the circumstances of their use.. The report explores
		the association of variations in a number of specific personal, organizational,
		and technological factors with variations in the use of sources of 
		information.. In a more general interpretation of these findings, those
		variations are related to aspects of the goals of the work to which the
		information was applied..
		   The purposes of technical work are considered along two basic dimensions,
		one relating to the potential for contribution to the development of some body
		of systematic knowledge, the other to the support of particular operational
		objectives.. When the focus of work is on operational goals, local and informal
		sources account for most instances of information transfer.. Formal and more
		distant sources are the most common means used when the focus is on 
		"professional" goals, i.e., those concerned with contributions to knowledge..
		   In conclusion, the report discusses the effects which management may have,
		within an organization, on the process of information transfer, and the need 
		for managers and students of the process to take into account the interplay in
		this process of personal values, task requisites, and the structure of formal 
		and social groups.. Firms need to establish two-way communication about needs 
		and  possibilities; by so doing they may enhance the effectiveness with which
		advances in knowledge are translated into innovations in technology meeting the
		needs of society..
