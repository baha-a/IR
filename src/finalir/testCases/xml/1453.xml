		  There are some who question whether the status of women in the
		library profession is a major issue.  A survey of library literature,
		however shows an increase in the factual data available regarding
		differences between men and women in salaries, promotional patterns
		and other professional situations. There are local library groups
		which are examining the status of women in their own libraries and
		organizing to improve their employment situations.  On the state
		and national level, conference programs and workshops at library
		association meetings have dealt with various aspects of sex
		discrimination, affirmative action policies, sexism in children's
		materials and the like.
