	<title>Minimum Vocabularies in Information Indexing	</title>

		   Words have no precision, though in information storage and retrieval we are
		required to act as if they did.. We have, therefore, to impose certain 
		arbitrary conditions to reduce the element of personal interpretation..
		'Meaning' must be remove from the indexing stage to that of vocabulary 
		construction.. Vocabularies can be reduced to a minimum, first to a core of 
		terms used in specialist science, and, following Russel, ultimately to
		undefined terms symbolic of sense experience.. 'Basic English' has shown 
		similar minimizing to be feasible for a natural language.. The success of
		Batten cards shown that the principle could be equally applicable to specialist 
		indexing vocabularies..
