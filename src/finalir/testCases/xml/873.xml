	<title>Content Designators for Machine-Readable Records: A Working Paper	</title>

	<text>
		   Under the auspices of the International Federation of Library Association's
		Committees on Cataloging and Mechanization, an International Working Group on
		Content Designators was formed to attempt to resolve the differences in the 
		content designators assigned by national agencies to their machine-readable 
		bibliographic records..
		   All working papers emanating from the IFLA Working Group will be submitted
		to the International Standards Organization Technical Committee 46, Subcommittee 
		4, Working Group on Content Designators..
		   Prior to any attempt to standardize the content designators for the 
		international exchange of bibliographic data in machine-readable form, it is 
		necessary to agree on certain basic points from which all future work will be 
		derived.. This first working paper is a statement of: 1) the obstacles that 
		presently exist which prevent the effective international interchange of
		bibliographic data in machine-readable form; 2) the score of concern for the
		IFLA Working Group; and 3) the definition of terms included in the broader term
		"content designators"..
		   If an international standard format can be derived, it would greatly 
		facilitate the use in this country of machine-readable bibliographic records
		issued by other national agencies.. It should also contribute significantly to 
		the expansion of MARC to other languages by the Library of Congress..
