		  Scientific research is expensive and the practical application of its
		results is even more expensive.  Information services are relatively
		inexpensive and, by constantly improving their scope and efficiency and
		encouraging the scientist to make the best use of them, we can minimize
		duplication and inefficiency in research and development.  This is the
		justification for the present survey and for all the work on user needs
		which has preceded it.
