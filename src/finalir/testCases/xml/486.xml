	<title>Relevance Assessments and Retrieval System Evaluation	</title>

		   Two widely used criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of information 
		retrieval system are, respectively, the recall and the precision.. Since the 
		determination of these measures is dependent on a distinction between documents 
		which are relevant to a given query and documents which are not relevant to that
		query, it has sometimes been claimed that an accurate, generally valid 
		evaluation cannot be based on recall and precision measures..
		   A study was made to determine that effect of variations in relevance 
		assessments on the average recall and precision values used to measure 
		retrieval effectiveness.. Using a collection of 1200 documents in information 
		science for test purposes, it is found that large scale differences in the 
		relevance assessments do not produce significant variations in average recall 
		and precision.. It thus appears that properly computed recall and precision 
		data may represent effectiveness indicators which are generally valid for many 
		distinct user classes..
