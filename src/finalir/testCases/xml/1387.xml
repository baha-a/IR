		  The essay that follows is the first full published report on a
		project originally conceived almost fifteen years ago.  At that
		time I was a graduate student in theoretical physics already
		within sight of the end of my dissertation.  A fortunate involvement
		with an experimental college course treating physical
		science for the non-scientist provided my first exposure to
		out-of-date scientific theory and practice radically undermined
		some of my basic conceptions about the nature of science and
		the reasons for its special success.
		  Those conceptions were ones I had previously drawn partly
		from scientific training itself and partly from a long-standing
		avocational interest in the philosophy of science.  Somehow,
		whatever their pedagogic utility and their abstract plausibility,
		those notions did not at all fit the enterprise that historical study
		displayed.  Yet they were and are fundamental to many discussions
		of science, and their failures of verisimilitude therefore
		seemed thoroughly worth pursuing.  The result was a drastic
		shift in my career plans, a shift from physics to history of
		science and then, gradually, from relatively straightforward
		historical problems back to the more philosophical concerns that
		had initially led me to history.  Except for a few articles, this
		essay is the first of my published works in which these early
		concerns are dominant.  In some part it is an attempt to explain
		to myself and to friends how I happened to be drawn from
		science to its history in the first place.
