	<title>Informational Reviews in the Age of Information Crisis	</title>
	<author>Altsculer, M.S.	</author>
	<text>
		  A critical analysis is given of existing classification
		schemes for reviews.  The author proposes to distinguish
		between two main review types: orienting and informative
		ones.  The importance is stressed of informative
		(analytical and abstracting) reviews, which contain
		new information under the conditions of information
		crisis being interpreted as overproduction of documents
		rather than new knowledge.
