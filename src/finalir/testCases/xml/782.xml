		  A new estimate of the number of currently published scientific and
		technical periodicals has been put forward by K.P. Barr of the National
		Lending Library.  It may be of interest to supplement this with some figures
		on the number and distribution of articles within these periodicals.  These
		figures are derived from a survey undertaken at the NLL early in 1964.
