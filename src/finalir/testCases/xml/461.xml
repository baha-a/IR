		    The present book embodies a change in structure and focus to reflect
		the fact that the reader of today's book is much more likely to be an
		interested college student with a great awareness of the current information
		revolution than was the case ten years ago.  Thus, hardware, materials, and
		processes used in connection with information systems are discussed first,
		in Chapters Two through Four.  The subject of information retrieval per se
		begins with Chapters Five and Six, which have to do with librarianship 
		and documentation.  Because of their somewhat historical slant, these
		chapters (along with Seven) are the only ones taken from the 1963 book
		which adhere to their original character.  Chapter Seven presents a simplified
		concept of an information system and its components, and paves the way for
		discussion of computerized retrieval in the chapters to follow, especially
		for data retrieval in Chapter Eight and document retrieval in Chapter Nine.
		Chapters Ten through Twelve, on language processing, evaluation, and user
		studies, describe important facets of the information retrieval field that have
		developed strongly since 1963.
