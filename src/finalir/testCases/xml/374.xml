		    Following five years of experience with the mechanization
		of procedures using data processing equipment, the university
		library in Bochum is attempting to summarize its findings.
		A comparison with earlier publications about the use of
		electronic data processing equipment shows in what measure
		the original plans have actually been affected by the
		experience that has been gained.  This summary also serves
		as a report for the wider public that may be interested in
		technical questions of library processing.
