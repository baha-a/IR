	<text>
		        This volume is intended mainly as a source book for
		project and program ideas for libraries now engaged in working
		with the disadvantaged or planning to do so.  It is also
		hoped that it will give an overview of the progress to date in
		work with the disadvantaged by bringing together much of the
		thinking and many of the ideas that have appeared in literature
		or in conferences in the last few years.
