		Text processing problems (such as automatic translation and automatic
		abstracting) create a need for defining explicit concepts, which should be
		characterized as the properties and quantity of semantic information
		contained in document texts.
		In fact, we need a formal model, which lets us describe the process of
		semantic text analysis.
		  Semantic text analysis could be described from the point of view of someone
		with a different "conception of the world" - e.g. the text of very meaningful
		article does not contain, in fact, any information for people who are not
		specialists in the given mathematic field.
		Therefore, the formal model must contain descriptions of the "conception of the
		world: of the given observer.
		Such a description we call a thesaurus.
		  Semantic text analysis we interpret as changing the thesaurus in response
		to a given text.
