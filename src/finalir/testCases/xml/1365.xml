	<title>Centralization vs. Decentralization:A Location Analysis Approach for Librarians	</title>
	<author>Raffel, J.Shishko, R.	</author>
	<text>
		  An application of location theory to
		the question of centralized versus
		decentralized library facilities for a
		university, with relevance for special 
		libraries is presented.  Locating university
		libraries near classrooms, offices, and
		dormitories requires a larger budget
		than combining these libraries into a 
		centralized facility.  Yet there is a cost
		to the university community which does not 
		appear in the university budget - a cost
		in time, energy, and decreased use resulting
		from locating the library a longer distance
		from users.  The analysis provides models
		for a single library, for two or more libraries,
		or for decentralized facilities.
