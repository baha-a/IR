		  A survey of the information use patterns and communication practices
		of academic physicists in the  greater Boston area reveals that academic 
		physicists rely heavily on formal and informal sources of information.  Their
		use of formal publications concentrates on a small number of journal titles.  
		Time and location factors play an important role
		in their information seeking and gathering. A considerable number of the
		physicists surveyed do not seek librarians' help when searching for
		information in the library.  Although libraries have been considered largely as
		storehouses of materials and librarians organizers of these materials, more 
		active roles for librarians are possible.
