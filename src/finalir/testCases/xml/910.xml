		  It has been suggested by various librarians concerned with inner-city
		service that the library serve as an informational and interpersonal link
		between community residents and social agencies.  The major question is
		whether it is necessary to add another agency to the already overburdened
		social service bureaucracy.  The rationale for envisioning the library in
		this role is twofold:  (1) the library has achieved a reputation for
		impartiality because it provides information on all sides of an issue and
		is not committed to any particular action program, community service or
		clientele; and (2) librarians are specifically trained to locate, organize,
		update and disseminate information.
