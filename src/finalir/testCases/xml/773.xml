		   The computerized information centre of the European Atomic Energy Community
		has become operational.. A survey of its principal characteristics is given, and
		the main problems that arose in the development phase of the system are 
		discussed.. The Euratom Thesaurus includes graphic representation of 
		relationships between indexing terms.. A dual vocabulary allows specific 
		indexing for high relevance and generic indexing for high recall.. Retrieval 
		strategy involves utilization of Boolean operators and frequency-of-occurrence 
		tables.. Recall ration can be determined graphically by a continuous approach 
		method.. Indexing consistency tests show that it pays to use subject 
		specialists.. User's needs are discussed in terms of subject coverage, 
		specificity, rapidity, and presentation.. The user service comprises 
		retrospective searches on request as well as customer profile service on 
		subscription.. There are three types of relevance, and various ways of bringing
		system relevance to coincide with user relevance.. The Centre's budgetary 
		requirements are low, due to circumspect use of its computer, an IBM 360, model
		40.. Its aims are centralization of documentation in the nuclear field and
		international co-operation..
