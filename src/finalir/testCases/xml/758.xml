	<title>A Scientific Theory of Classification and Indexing and Its Practical Application	</title>

		   A classification is a theory of the structure of knowledge.. From a 
		discussion of the nature of truth, it is held that scientific knowledge is the 
		only knowledge which can be regarded as true.. The method of induction from 
		empirical data is therefore applied to the construction of a classification..
		Items of knowledge are divided into uniquely definable terms, called isolates,
		and the relations between them, called operators.. It is shown that only four
		basic operators exist, expressing appurtenance, equivalence, reaction, and
		causation; using symbols for these operators, all subjects can be analysed in a
		linear form called an analet.. With the addition of the permissible permutations
		of such analets, formed according to simple rules, alphabetical arrangement of 
		the first terms provides a complete, logical subject index.. Examples are given,
		and possible difficulties are considered.. A classification can then be
		constructed by selection of deductive relations, arranged in hierarchical form..
		The nature of possible classifications is discussed.. It is claimed that such an
		inductively constructed classification is the only true representation of the
		structure of knowledge, and that these principles provide a simple technique
		for accurately and fully indexing and classifying any given set of data, with
		complete flexibility..
