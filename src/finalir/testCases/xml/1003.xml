		   It has been proposed recently that rule 6 of the Anglo-American Cataloging 
		Rules (AACR), relating to entry of serials, be replaced by the conventions for 
		description of serials outlined in ISBD(S): International Standard Bibliographic
		Description for Serials, which in itself incorporates (or accommodates) another 
		convention, that of the "keytitle", an essential aspect of the International 
		Standard Serial Number (ISSN).. Viewed in the current library context, this 
		recommendation is irresponsible and indefensible on both a theoretical and
		practical level..
