	<title>An Inquiry on New Forms of Primary Publications	</title>
	<author>Moore, J.A.	</author>
	<text>
		  Some of the problems associated with present journal publications practices 
		are discussed.  These are attributed to the fact that as the literature has
		expanded, the needs of both authors and readers are no longer being met by
		printing and distributing all of the material accepted to all subscribers.
		A two-edition system is proposed, with short versions of papers in a broad
		circulation issue and expanded versions, including full details and discussion, 
		in library-circulation microfilm editions.  Reactions of chemists to such
		a system are discussed.  It is recommended that two-edition journals be
		developed in a evolutionary way by increasing use of the ACS mcirofilm 
		editions for sections of articles and for supplementary documents to accompany
		communications.
