		  In the literature, active network plans and developments appear to cluster 
		in three main areas: (1) Education, (2) Libraries, and (3) Government, Industry,
		and Professional Societies.  These network groupings are described in this
		chapter following a discussion of network definitions, concepts, and current
		impetus.  References to information systems are included when there is an 
		indication that a particular system will probably be transformed into a network.
