	<text>
		   A structured questionnaire was administered to professional personnel in 
		industrial and government organizations, asking the subjects to rank eight 
		information gathering methods according to their preference in given
		hypothetical situation.. The subjects were then asked to rate the methods on a
		seven point scale according to (a) ease of use and (b) amount of information 
		expected.. The subjects were divided into two groups determined by their time
		spent in research or research related activities.. The groups were designated
		"research" and "nonresearch"..
		   A statistical analysis of the data from 96 subjects (52 in research, 44 in
		nonresearch) showed that no statistically significant differences were present 
		in either the rankings or ratings between research and nonresearch personnel.. 
		   The results of the study infer that the ease of use of an information
		gathering method is more important than the amount of information expected for
		information gathering methods in industrial and government, regardless of the 
		research orientation of the users..
