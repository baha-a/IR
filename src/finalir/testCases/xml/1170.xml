		   Aspects of subject acquisition and retrieval of patent information are
		discussed.. A patent-information service system is conventionally separated
		into two parts:  a subject acquisitions system designed for stock acquisition
		and search file building, and a detailed subject retrieval system designed to
		deal with specific user requests.. The performance of both systems is analyzed
		using patent classifications as examples.. The tasks of classification research
		in relation to subject acquisitions system requirements are formulated..
