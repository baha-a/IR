		  In science and technology user studies are numerous and have a
		history of some twenty years.  The relevance of the methodology
		of science user studies to the social sciences is considered in 
		Chapter 2.  The pressing need in user studies, in science as well
		as social science, is for a general body of theory about the flow
		of information in research and teaching communities.  Some of the
		fundamental characteristics of social science research and its
		literature which have a bearing upon investigations of information
		needs and requirements are considered in the first part of Chapter
		3, and the second part is devoted to a review of empirical studies
		in the social sciences.  Other relevant material about the use made
		of information is discussed in Chapter 4 on systematic approaches.
