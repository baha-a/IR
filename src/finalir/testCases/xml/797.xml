		  Classification is so fundamental and pervasive an activity that care
		is needed to define its scope when discussing a particular application, such
		as information retrieval.
		  Retrieval from an information store (a 'library') of those items relevant
		to a request involves locating a particular class (describing what we think
		we want) and then, if necessary, adjusting this class - broadening it to find
		more material or narrowing it if the initial response proves excessive.  This
		implies recognition of the relations between the classes, and the whole
		operation is often referred to neatly as 'locating and relating'.  Assuming
		that we examine only a limited set of documents (those most likely to be
		relevant) the operation is entirely one of classification - the recognition of
		particular classes and their relations.  The fact that the instrument we use to
		assist this operation may display quasi-classificatory features (e.g.,
		alphabetical sequence) or may consist largely of our own brain box and memory
		store should not hide this otherwise obvious fact.
