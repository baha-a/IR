		        The MARC (Machine-Readable-Cataloging) Pilot Project was an
		experiment to test the feasibility of distributing Library of Congress
		cataloging in machine-readable form to a variety of users.  This project
		grew out of the conviction of many librarians that automation was becoming
		necessary if libraries were to keep up with the rising tide of new
		materials and the mounting demand for rapid information.  Although there
		were other library procedures which stood to profit from mechanization,
		it was felt that devising a method of recording bibliographical information
		in machine-readable form was basic to the solution of other problems.
