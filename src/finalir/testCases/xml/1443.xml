		  We feel that a profound change has occurred in linguistic thinking
		in the last decade.  It is not longer of any interest to describe
		one after another language 'anyhow' without regard to the relevance
		of the facts to general linguistic theory.  As Ross put it, it makes
		no sense to talk about 'describing a language in terms of its own
		structure alone.'  Toward the end of the conference, when it had become
		apparent that the general agreement did not encompass any currently
		explicitly formulated model, the question was raised:  What should we
		be teaching our students?  Langendoen's answer seems to us most apt:
		We should give them the ability to recognize a interesting linguistic
		problem when they see one, that is, one which throws some light -
		negative or positive - on our conceptions of what languages in general
		are like.
