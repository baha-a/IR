	<title>Language and Information Selected Essays on their Theory and Application	</title>
	<author>Barhillel, Y.	</author>
	<text>
		  At one time or another many authors must have faced the dilemma of
		whether to gather their articles published on a certain topic and republish
		them as a collection of essays or whether to rework them into an entirely
		new book.  I decided in favor of the first course with regard to the articles
		I had written during the last fifteen years on language and information,
		in particular on the more technical and applied aspects, leaving for some
		future occasion my papers on the philosophy of language.
