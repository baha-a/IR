	<title>Program Design for Retrospective Searches on Large Data Bases	</title>

		   Retrospective search of large document data bases requires development of 
		special techniques for automatic compression of data and minimization of the 
		number of input-output operations to the computer accessible files.. Also, the 
		computer program should be designed to require a relatively small amount of 
		internal memory..
		   The present paper contains a description of the structure of a program that 
		meets the above requirements.. The vocabulary of the data base is automatically 
		expressed in terms of 8, 16 and 24 bit codes chosen to point to the natural 
		spelling in a dictionary.. Thus file size is reduced without the necessity for
		extensive processing for decoding.. Use of a compressed bit string inverted
		index greatly reduces search time, and a storage management system enables long
		strings to be processed with use of a limited amount of internal storage..
		Creation of "reduced" files and tables is an important feature of a program; it
		allows the files needed only by specific phases of the program to be designed 
		to use a relatively small amount of internal storage and input-output time..
