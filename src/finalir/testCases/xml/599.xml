		   The emergence and development of information science within its wider 
		disciplinary framework is interpreted.. Information science is approached as
		one of a modern generation of communication or behavioral disciplines which
		emerged almost simultaneously around World War II.. Consequently, an attempt is
		made to discern the evolution of relationship between information science and
		other generation disciplines.. The internal development of information science
		is first sketched.. Second, possible relationship and roles of information 
		science within a potentially emergent suprasystem of knowledge are discussed..
