		    The combination of computers and communications technology
		is a development whose time has come for libraries in the U.S.
		    And despite missteps and false starts inevitable in adapting
		the new technology for its use, libraries are now rapidly
		expanding telecommunications networks to serve their need to
		disseminate ever-expanding amounts of information in more
		effective ways.
		    It makes a good deal of sense when one considers that the
		library's function is to parcel out information, and that
		information can be forwarded electronically as easily as it can
		be mailed.
		    In fact, the logic of library networks is such that everyone
		is hopping on the bandwagon -- consultants, systems analysts,
		state agencies and a growing list of manufacturers that includes
		Xerox and International Business Machines.  Their initial efforts
		are concentrated on what are basically bookkeeping tasks -- in
		particular, the cataloging of new acquisitions.  The Ohio college
		Library Center, for example, provides its customers with entries
		for their card catalog files; and because OCLC is the first and
		most extensive of the networks, its approach is being closely
		copied by the others.
