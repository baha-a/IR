	<title>The Librarian:  From Occupation to Profession?	</title>

		  An industrial society has an open class stratification system; it
		offers some an opportunity to rise, but it offers no guarantee against
		downward social mobility.  Compared to other types of societies, this one
		demands a wider variety of higher level skills and thus generates much
		pressure against the forces that in all societies tend to keep the individual 
		in his original caste or class.  Much of the resulting mobility is based on a 
		radical change which has taken place in the occupational structure of modern
		industrial societies, one which neither Marx nor orthodox economists 
		anticipated, an expansion of the demand for professional and technical skills 
		of a high order.
		  Thus not only are individuals competing with one another in their efforts to
		rise in the class system, but occupations, too, are engaged in the same 
		competition and may move up or down in power, prestige, or income.
