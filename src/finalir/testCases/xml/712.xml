		  Abstracts can serve their purpose best only if they are
		carefully written to transmit important information to
		readers quickly and accurately.  This requires knowledge
		of audience needs, habits, and desires; ability to identify
		the key facts in the document; ability to organize these
		facts, to present them in the order best suited to the
		audience; and ability to write the abstracts clearly,
		concisely, and in conformity with the style rules of the
		medium involved.  Some of these abilities are inborn, but
		all can be learned by study, practice, and criticism.
