		  It is easiest of all to apply mechanization and automation to the
		transmission, accumulation and search of information.  Automation
		can also be extended to cover some more complicated functions.  In
		all of these cases, the results supplied by automatic devices are
		analysed and decisions are taken usually by man.  Thus, the role of
		machine is to considerably extend man's capabilities rather than to
		completely replace man. 
		  The automated systems intended to accumulate and search for information
		have come to be called information-retrieval systems (IRS).  These
		systems can also perform the simpler forms of data processing.
		The physical facilities of these systems are communications equipment,
		punched-card computers, microfilming equipment, and electronic computers,
		the latter playing the most prominent part.
