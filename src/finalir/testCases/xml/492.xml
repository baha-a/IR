		  The purpose of an information-retrieval system is to provide the user with
		citations relevant to his query.  Since the user is the only person competent
		to make the final judgement of relevance it is natural to suppose that the
		selection of items from a data base will lead to two kinds of retrieval
		error.  The extent of these errors is expressed by the familiar measures
		of performance, precision and recall.  Precision measures the failure of the
		system to retrieve only relevant documents while recall measures its failure
		to retrieve all relevant documents actually present in the data base.  It is
		difficult to visualize a situation in which a user would find advantage in
		being provided with irrelevant citations.  From the user's point of view,
		therefore, a system which offers less than 100 per cent precision is a
		deficient system.
