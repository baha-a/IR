		  Citation indexing is a relatively new method of organizing the contents of a
		collection of documents in a way that overcomes many of the shortcomings of the
		more traditional indexing methods.  The primary advantage of citation indexing
		is that it identifies relationships between documents that are often overlooked
		in a subject index.  An important secondary advantage is that the compilation 
		of citation indexes is especially well suited to the use of man-machine indexing
		methods that do not require indexers who are subject specialists.  Furthermore,
		citations, which are bibliographic descriptions of documents, are not 
		vulnerable to scientific and technological obsolescence as are the terms used
		in subject indexes.
