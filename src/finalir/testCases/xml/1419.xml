	<title>Utility of Automatic Classification Systems for Information Storage andRetrieval	</title>
	<author>Litofsky, Barry	</author>
	<text>
		   Large-scale, on-line information storage and retrieval systems pose numerous 
		problems above those encountered by smaller systems.. The more critical of
		these problems involve: degree of automation, flexibility, browsability, 
		storage space, and retrieval time.. A step toward the solution of these problems 
		is presented here along with several demonstrations of feasibility and 
		advantages..
		   The methodology on which this solution is based is that of a posteriori 
		automatic classification of the document collection.. Feasibility is 
		demonstrated by automatically classifying a file of 50,000 document 
		descriptions.. The advantages of automatic classification are demonstrated by
		establishing methods for measuring the quality of classification systems and
		applying these measures to a number of different classification strategies..
		By indexing the 50,000 documents by two independent methods, one manual and 
		one automatic, it is shown that these advantages are not dependent upon the 
		indexing method used..
		   It was found that among those automatic classification algorithms studied,
		one particular algorithm, CLASFY, consistently outperformed the others.. In
		addition, it was found that this algorithm produced classifications at least
		as good, with respect to the measured established in this dissertation, as
		the a priori, manual classification system currently in use with the 
		aforementioned file..
		   The actual classification schedules produced by CLASFY in classifying a 
		file of almost 50,000 document descriptions into 265 categories are included
		as an appendix to this dissertation..
