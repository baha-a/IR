	<title>Library Education and the Public Library	</title>

		  A major and largely justifiable criticism of library education has always
		been that it is too closely tied to present practices and that it trains
		for current service instead of educating for growth and change.  Unfortunately,
		the picture many faculty members have of what today's
		requirements for public library service are tends to be obsolete.  Graduates 
		are thus doubly handicapped.  Not only do we fail to educate, we fail
		even to provide realistic training.  At worst, we perpetuate the past and
		train people for tasks that are no longer central to the concerns of public
		libraries.   Library education, like the public
		library itself, will have to accelerate the pace of change or risk the fate of
		oblivion.  Institutions that can move with the times and maintain a position
		of relevance to contemporary affairs will survive.  Others will wither
		away, disappear, or be replaced by more responsive agencies.  There is no
		shortage of prophets of doom for both the public library and for
		graduate library education, but there are plenty of signs of life yet in both.
		An article in the June 13, 1968 issue of The Reporter called "Dust Gathers
		on the Public Library" summed up nicely the apparent slow decline and
		loss of purpose of a once-revered institution (however, The Reporter is
		dead - while the public library lives on).
