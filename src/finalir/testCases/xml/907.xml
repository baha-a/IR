		  This report of research on concepts and problems of
		"Libraries of the Future" records the result of a two-year
		inquiry into the applicability of some of the newer
		techniques for handling information to what goes at present
		by the name of library work - i.e, the operations connected
		with assembling information in recorded form and of
		organizing and making it available for use.
