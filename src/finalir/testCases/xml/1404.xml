	<title>Technical Libraries; users and their demands:a classification of user groups and user demandsin technical libraries	</title>
	<author>Slater, M.	</author>
	<text>
		        This study of the habits of customers of technical
		libraries and information departments had three main aims.
		1. Determination of user demands:  to discover what items of
		information or documents customers seek, why they seek
		them and how they obtain them.
		2. Classification of user groups and their demands:  to test a
		hypothesis; that it is possible to classify customers into
		meaningful user groups possessing recognizable common
		features and characteristic behavior patterns, and to
		classify group needs.
		3. Estimation of the significance of the above for librarians:
		to measure the demand on librarians and libraries, in
		terms of expenditure of their time and skill, and use of
		stock made by different user groups.
