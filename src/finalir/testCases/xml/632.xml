	<title>Co-citation in the Scientific Literature: A New Measure of theRelationship Between Two Documents	</title>
	<author>Small, Henry	</author>
	<text>
		   A new form of document coupling called co-citation is defined as the
		frequency with which two documents are cited together.. The co-citation
		frequency of two scientific papers can be determined by comparing lists
		of citing documents in the Science Citation Index and counting identical 
		entries.. Networks of co-cited papers can be generated for specific
		scientific specialties, and an example is drawn from the literature
		of particle physics.. Co-citation patterns are found to differ 
		significantly from bibliographic coupling patterns, but to agree
		generally with patterns of direct citation.. Clusters of co-cited
		papers provide a new way to study the specialty structure of science..
		They may provide a new approach to indexing and to the creation of SDI 
		profiles..
