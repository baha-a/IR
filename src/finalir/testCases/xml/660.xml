		   This paper reports on a novel technique for literature indexing and
		searching in a mechanized library system.. The notion of relevance is taken
		as the key concept in the theory of information retrieval and a comparative
		concept of relevance is explicated in terms of the theory of probability.. 
		The resulting technique called "Probabilistic Indexing," allows a computing
		machine, given a request for information, to make a statistical inference
		and derive a number (called the "relevance number") for each document, which
		is a measure of the probability that the document will satisfy the given request
		ranked according to their probable relevance..
		   The paper goes on to show that whereas in a conventional library
		system the cross-referencing ("see" and "see also") is based solely on
		the "semantical closeness" between index terms, statistical measures of
		closeness between index terms can be defined and computed.. Thus, given
		an arbitrary request consisting of one (or many) index term(s), a machine
		can elaborate on it to increase the probability of selecting relevant
		documents that would not otherwise have been selected..
		   Finally, the paper suggests an interpretation of the whole library
		problem as one where the request is considered as a clue on the basis of
		which the library system makes a concatenated statistical inference
		in order to provide as an output an ordered list of those documents
		which most probably satisfy the information needs of the user..
