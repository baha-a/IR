	<title>The Lending of Books to One Another by Libraries	</title>
	<author>Green, S.S.	</author>

		  It would add greatly to the usefulness of our reference libraries if an 
		agreement should be made to lend books to each other for short periods of time.
		It happens not unfrequently that some book is called for by a reader, or that
		in looking up the answer to a question a librarian has occasion to use a book 
		which he finds in the catalogue of another library, but which does not belong 
		to his own collection. The book, very likely, is one that can be replaced
		if lost.  But it would take time to get it through ordinary channels; it might 
		be necessary to send abroad for a copy or to wait to pick up one, if the book 
		is scarce.  In such a case it would be a great convenience to be able to
		borrow a book for a few days.
