		   The design and study of library information networks are enhanced by the use 
		of the concepts which have been developed by graph theorists.. In this paper we
		expand upon this theme, proposing a general network structure which we believe
		to be a good model for a wide variety of library and other information 
		networks.. The basic concepts from graph theory are illustrated with the aid of 
		a hypothetical Public Library Access Network (PLAN)..
