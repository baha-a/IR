		  The goal of this study is to reach a deeper understanding of some
		concepts we believe are crucial to the general theory of computation.
		We will study in great detail a class of computations that make
		decisions by weighing evidence.  Certainly, this problem is of
		great interest in itself, but our real hope is that understanding
		of its mathematical structure will prepare us eventually to go
		further into the almost unexplored theory of parallel computers.
