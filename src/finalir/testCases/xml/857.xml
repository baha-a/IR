		   A computer based laboratory for library science students to use in class 
		assignments and for independent projects has been developed and used for one 
		year at Syracuse University.. MARC Pilot Project tapes formed the data base.. 
		Different computer programs and various samples of the MARC file (48,000 
		records, approx.) were used for search and retrieval operations..  Data bases,
		programs, and seven different class assignments are described and evaluated for 
		their impact on library education in general and individual students and faculty
		in particular..
