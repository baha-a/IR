	<title>User Experiences with Primary Journals on 16-Mm Microfilm	</title>
	<author>Starker, L.N.	</author>
	<text>
		  The availability of scientific journals on 16-mm film is a relatively new
		phenomenon.  User acceptance of this microfilm application has been greatly       
		improved by loading the file into cartridges and making use of motor-driven
		reader-printers.  This equipment permits rapid searching of the microfilm
		and adds the convenience of on-the-spot hard-copy prints as needed.  Of prime  
		importance are the economic advantages of these editions, since they allow many
		special libraries to stretch greatly the space available to them for journal
		housing.  The economics of this approach are also discussed, as are the 
		reactions of the scientists and information personnel who use them.
