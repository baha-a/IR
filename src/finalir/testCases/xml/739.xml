	<text>
		   This paper presents a rapid and efficient generalized minicomputer text 
		searching system.. The system has been applied to Chemical Condensates and
		enjoys search speeds comparable to services operating on large computer 
		systems.. Complete Boolean algebraic search strategy expressions may be used as 
		direct entries, and all forms of transaction are automatically processed.. 
		Benchmark search speeds and results are presented for realistic profiles 
		serving varied research groups in a major university chemistry department..
