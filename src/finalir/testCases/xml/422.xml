		   The problem of organizing a large mass of data occurs frequently in 
		research.. Normally, some process of generalization is used to compress the 
		data so that it can be analyzed more easily.. A primitive step in this process 
		is the "clustering" technique, which involves gathering together similar data 
		into a cluster to permit a significant generalization..
		   This paper describes a number of methods which make use of IBM 7090 computer
		programs to do clustering.. A medical research problem is used to illustrate
		and compare these methods..
