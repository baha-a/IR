		  The academic users of the bibliographic information dissemination center
		were surveyed to determine the ways in which the search results were being
		used, the impact which the services had had on professional activities such
		as research and instruction, the interface between the computer-based
		retrieval and the traditional form of library resources, and the effect of
		document overlap between different data bases.  The survey results indicate
		that the dissemination services are being used by a large portion of the
		faculty and the graduate students within the University System of Georgia,
		with an average of 3 to 5 people seeing the bibliography from each search
		question.  Over 97% of the respondees indicated some or substantial
		contribution to their professional activities, with the major contributions 
		being a savings or more efficient use of time and broadened subject
		coverage.  The users indicated several changes in library use habits as a
		result of the computer-based searches, among them more direct access to the
		primary literature and increased use of library resources as they had been
		made aware of new sources and media - e.g., microforms.  Percentage
		responses on these and related topics are presented.
