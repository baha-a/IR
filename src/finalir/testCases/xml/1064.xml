	<title>Modern Manuscripts  A Practical Manual for Their Management, Care and Use	</title>
	<author>Duckett, K.W.	</author>
	<text>
		                The title of this book is intended to indicate
		that its scope is limited to manuscripts of the seventeenth century
		to the present.  Examples and techniques are drawn from institutions
		in the United States with occasional references to practices in Great
		Britain and Canada.  The book is directed toward the novice curator
		of manuscripts, and, again, as the title indicates, it is intended to 
		serve as a practical guide, not as an exposition of theory.
