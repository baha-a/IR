		Sir,-In his recent article B.C. Brookes propounds an ingenious mathematical
		framework to determine which periodical volumes a library should hold.  He is
		careful to point out that the selection will need regular review and revision, 
		in case the value of the aging factor a or the
		contents of the Bradford set change from year to year.  There is as yet very 
		little experimental evidence on the consistency
		of either.  Such limited evidence as there is suggests that the aging factor 
		is reasonably constant.  But the position of
		the Bradfod set is less satisfactory.  The Nature Conservancy librarians (J. M.
		Weingott and S. M. Penny, unpublished) have lent me a list of titles cited in 
		the Journal of Ecology three or more times in
		1955-56, and a similar list for 1965-66. There are 150 periodical titles in 
		the two lists, but only forty-two (28%) appear in
		both.  Of the thirty-three titles cited nine or more times in either year, 
		only eight (25%) attained that level in both, and
		twelve were cited less than three times in the other year.  The Kendall rank 
		correlation coefficient between the two years is 0.18 and not significant.
		  There is another major practical problem. The article assumes that the data
		analyzed to obtain aging or utility factors and Bradford sets are valid
		parameters of the relative value of the literature to the readers.  There is no
		mention of the type of data to use.  The reader who sought guidance from the 
		earlier literature cited would find practical techniques described in which 
		analyses of citation frequencies are used to calculate utilities discussed in 
		terms of library use.  Krauze and Hillinger have
		discussed the difference between citations in one article and future citations 
		to that article.  Their work implies a more complex
		relation between a and u than Brookes suggests.  In any case, the validity of
		citations for forecasting library consultations
		remains unproven, and there are prima facie reasons why the relationship is not
		necessarily close.  For example, one item in a list of references is often 
		intended to lead to a chain of earlier papers.  Again,
		each citation represents an author's selection from a wider group most of 
		which he has consulted in a library.  In neither case is there any
		inherent reason for similarity of age distribution or of pool of titles between 
		the list of citations and the items read by the author or his readers.
