		  Librarians and information scientists are vitally concerned
		with network development for a number of important reasons.
		First, the network concept implies removal of all geographic
		barriers to knowledge; this is made possible by advances in
		telecommunications technology.  Second, a network implies
		equal access by any individual for any purpose to the sum total
		of the nation's knowledge resources; this has been a long-standing
		educational goal.  And third, a network implies positive
		redirection of the basic professional goals and objectives of
		librarianship and information science.
