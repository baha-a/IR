	<title>Social Factors in the Origins of a New Science: The Case of Psychology	</title>
	<author>Ben-David, JosephCollins, Randall	</author>

		   The uninterrupted growth of a scientific field depends upon the existence of 
		a scientific community permanently devoting itself to the field.. Therefore, the
		new idea is not sufficient to start the take-off into sustained growth in a new 
		field; a new role must be created as well.. In scientific psychology, this 
		occurred in the late nineteenth century in Germany.. Using Germany as a 
		positive case, and France, Britain and the United States as negative cases, it
		is shown that the new role resulted from academic career opportunities favoring
		the mobility of practitioners and students of psychology into other fields, and
		from the relatively low academic standing of speculative philosophy and its 
		consequent receptivity to persons and ideas which promised to turn the study of 
		the human mind into an experimental science..
