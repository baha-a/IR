Breaking the Communication barrier Between Searcher and Literature File: An Interactive Guide

Schultz, Louise

   The challenges of design of programming systems, file organization
and manipulation, and user-oriented query languages have held the spotlight
in the development of data processing support to systems for retrieval of
scientific literature.. At BIOSIS, development of such a system from the
pragmatic viewpoint of providing viable self-supporting retrieval service
from a data base of more than two million references has resulted in
focusing attention on supporting the formulation of the information need into
an effective computer search specification.. Developed under CPS and now
implemented under CICS, the program claims no novelty of structure or 
technique, but constitutes an innovation in application and goal with primary
emphasis on accommodating the behavior of a user not previously knowledgeable
about the structure, indexing language, and detailed content of a machine
based references file..
