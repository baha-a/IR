Deterioration and Preservation of Library Materials

Winger, H.W.

  The deterioration of library materials, constant since libraries began, has
accelerated to alarming proportions in 1969.  Researchers have predicted that
all paper-based records of this century, as well as those of earlier years,face
imminent ruin.  Without new and effective efforts for their preservation, most
will not be usable in their present form in the next century.  The danger of
destruction threatens not only research library collections but also the world
of knowledge and scholarship that they support. For not only paper is involved.
Similar dangers of destruction confront other cellulosic products, such as
film, which may substitute for paper as the material base of records.  And not
only research libraries are involved. The surprisingly rapid deterioration of
printed materials, even those that have been produced with some eye to 
permanence, creates problems and expenses for other libraries as well.
