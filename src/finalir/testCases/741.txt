Searching Chemical Abstracts vs. CA Condensates

Buntrock, Robert E.

   As of March 1975, as much as four and one-half years of Chemical Abstracts
Indexes and on-line accessible Chemical Abstracts Condensates can be compared..
Although combined searches of both data bases are the most effective, examples
are shown in which it is more practical and efficient to search CA Condensates..
CHEMCON and CHEM7071, the on-line versions of CA Condensates loaded at System
Development Corp. (SDC), are compared with CA Indexes..
