   As part of an investigation of health sciences library manpower, the
universe of health-related institutions and programs (excluding hospitals) was
surveyed by postcard questionnaire to produce an inventory and description of
libraries providing services to these institutions reported access to library
resources, indicating usage of some 2,207 non-hospital libraries.. Eighty
percent (2,431) of the institutions reported that the library used was "within"
their own institution; 20 percent (608) noted that the library was "outside"
of their institution..
   The distribution of health-related institutions and libraries is shown by
RML districts, together with relevant census data.. A classification of
libraries, based on the degree of involvement of the libraries' facilities,
resources and personnel in supplying services to health-related institutions,
was developed..
   It is concluded that projections of manpower needs should take into account
institutions and programs not at present possessing health sciences libraries
as well as documented demand in existing health sciences libraries..
