Informational Reviews in the Age of Information Crisis

Altsculer, M.S.

  A critical analysis is given of existing classification
schemes for reviews.  The author proposes to distinguish
between two main review types: orienting and informative
ones.  The importance is stressed of informative
(analytical and abstracting) reviews, which contain
new information under the conditions of information
crisis being interpreted as overproduction of documents
rather than new knowledge.
