The Lending of Books to One Another by Libraries

Green, S.S.

  It would add greatly to the usefulness of our reference libraries if an 
agreement should be made to lend books to each other for short periods of time.
It happens not unfrequently that some book is called for by a reader, or that
in looking up the answer to a question a librarian has occasion to use a book 
which he finds in the catalogue of another library, but which does not belong 
to his own collection. The book, very likely, is one that can be replaced
if lost.  But it would take time to get it through ordinary channels; it might 
be necessary to send abroad for a copy or to wait to pick up one, if the book 
is scarce.  In such a case it would be a great convenience to be able to
borrow a book for a few days.
