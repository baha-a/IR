Information in 1985; a forecasting study ofinformation needs and resources

Anderla, G.

    The primary purpose of this study is to estimate the supply of,
and above all the demand for, scientific and technical information;
its secondary objective is to make a long-term assessment of
qualitative and quantitative requirements for information specialists.
In both instances, of course, future technical developments, as far
as they can be foreseen, must be taken into account.
    At the same time, like most work sponsored by the OECD, its aim
is to identify significant criteria for defining a policy - in this
case an information policy, which is greatly needed in all OECD countries.
