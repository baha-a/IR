Linguistics and Information Science

Montgomery, C.A.

  This paper defines the relationship between linguistics
and information science in terms of a common interest
in natural language.  The notion of automated processing
of natural language - i.e., machine simulation of
the language processing activities of a human - provides
novel possibilities for interaction between linguists,
who have a theoretical interest in such activities,
and information scientists, who have more practical
goals, e.g. simulating the language processing activities
of an indexer with a machine.
  The concept of a natural language information system
is introduced as a framework for reviewing automated
language processing effort by computational
linguists and information scientists.  In terms of this
framework, the former have concentrated on automating
the operations of the component for content analysis
and representation, while the latter have emphasized
the data management component.  The complementary
nature of these developments allows the
postulation of an integrated approach to automated
language processing.  This approach, which is outlined
in the final sections of the paper, incorporates current
notions in linguistic theory and information science, as
well as design features of recent computational linguistic
models.
