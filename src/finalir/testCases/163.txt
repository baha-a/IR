The Information Uses and Needs of Social Scientists:An Overview of INFROSS

Line, M.B.

  When INFROSS began in the autumn of 1967, although a large number of
studies had been conducted into the requirements of scientists for information,
very little had been done in the field of social science information.  There are 
a number of possible reasons for this.  Social scientists, faced with a much 
smaller total volume of information, were much less information-conscious and
less inclined to seek for solutions.  There are very few specialist libraries
in the social sciences, and few librarians were therefore confronted with
social scientists' information needs in the same way as librarians in 
scientific libraries were confronted with users and their problems.  Finally,
until OSTI came along there was little in the way of funds to support this
kind of research.  This almost total absence of previous research had its
disadvantages and advantages.  There were very few clues to guide us, and we
were therefore working to a certain extent in the dark.  On the other hand,
we had a clean and open field uncorrupted by confusing and non-comparable
studies.  There is something to be said for being one of the first in a field.
