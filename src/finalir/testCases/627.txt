Theoretical Foundations of Thesaurus-Construction andSome Methodological Considerations for Thesaurus-Updating

Kim, Chai

   It was argued that the present-day thesaurus-construction and maintenance
rules and conventions are not theoretically based.. For this reason, there
are few rules and conventions for updating a thesaurus.. Consequently, 
most of the thesauri adopted by operating information storage and
retrieval systems are not systematically updated.. In order to 
investigate how thesauri are actually updated, a survey was conducted.. 
The working hypothesis was that the communication process between authors
and readers is linear in nature ("one-way" communication allowing no 
reciprocal feedback) if a thesaurus utilized in a system is not updated
by both indexers and question negotiators.. Findings show that thesauri
viewed from the communications point of view do not allow a cybernetic
process of communication ("both-way" communication).. The survey
indicated that the present practice of updating thesauri is largely
done by indexers alone.. No attempt was made to develop a theory of
thesaurus construction and updating.. It was, however, argued that
such a theory, if developed, should at least account for the concepts
of meaning and knowledge.. Within this theoretical framework, two
techniques are suggested to be considered for the systematic updating
of a thesaurus..
