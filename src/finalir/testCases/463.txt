Information Retrieval; British and American, 1876-1976

Metcalfe, J.

        Of eight chapters this first one deals with principles and
definitions and then with the slow development of information
retrieval through about 5,000 years until the introduction of
printing in Europe less than 500 years prior to our period
of principal coverage, 1876-1976.  This latter period coincides
with the second century of the United States of America,
during which were intensified earlier efforts to carry out one of
Washington's urgings in his Farewell Address:  "Promote
then, as an object of primary importance, institutions for the general diffusion
of knowledge."
