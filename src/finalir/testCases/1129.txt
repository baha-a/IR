Leontjeva, N. N.

   Discusses the possibility of setting up an IL with a development grammar 
and logic, capable of solving problems of diverse informational complexity
(documentary search, data search, automatic text, condensation, automatic

kind.. Its structure is described, and its potentialities for information
are followed.
