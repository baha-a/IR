Wiswesser, W.T.

  This manual is the culmination of a long search for a chemical
notation that should consist of symbols limited to those on the
standard typewriter keyboard.  The necessity for such a notation
has been made almost inescapable by recent tremendous advances in
technology and the vast growth of chemical literature.
