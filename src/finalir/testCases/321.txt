An Information-Theoretic Approach to Text Searchingin Direct Access Systems

Barton, I.J.Creasey, S.E.Lynch, M.F.Snell, M.J.

  Using direct access computer files of bibliographic
information, an attempt is made to overcome one of the
problems often associated with information retrieval,
namely, the maintenance and use of large dictionaries,
the greater part of which is used only infrequently.
A novel method is presented, which maps they hyperbolic
frequency distribution of text characteristics onto a
rectangular distribution.  This is more suited to 
implementation on storage devices.
  This method treats text as a string of characters
rather than words bounded by spaces, and chooses subsets
of strings such that their frequencies of occurrence are
more even than those of word types.  The members of this
subset are then used as index keys for retrieval.  The
rectangular distribution of key frequencies results in a much
simplified file organization and promises considerable
cost advantages.
