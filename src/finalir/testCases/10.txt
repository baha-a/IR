the theory of the impact tube at low pressure .
  a theoretical analysis has been made for an impact tube of the
relation between free-stream mach number and the impact and
free-stream pressures and densities for extremely low pressures .
it is shown that the results differ appreciably from the
corresponding continuum relations .
