Research Libraries and Technology

Fussler, H.H.

  The focus of the report is primarily upon the problems of the large,
university, research-oriented library.  It is here that one finds the most
difficult resource-access and bibliographical control problems.  If one can
significantly improve both of these operations for the large, research-oriented
institutions, there are likely to be direct or indirect benefits for the
smaller library, while the reverse situation is much less likely.
