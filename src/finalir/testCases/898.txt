a survey of buckling theory and experiment for circular
conical shells of constant thickness .
  a survey of the state-of-the-art
for the stability of thin-walled
conical shells is presented .  known
theoretical results are summarized
and compared with experiment .  the
shortcomings of present knowledge
and recommended work for the future
are discussed .
