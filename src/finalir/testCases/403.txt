Government Publications:  A Guide to Bibliographic Tools

Palic, V.M.

  The expansion of government at all levels - international, national,
provincial or state, and local - has resulted in increasing government
influence on the life of each citizen.  Concomitant with this development
is the proliferation of published directives, regulations, reports,
technical studies, and other informational issuances in such volume that no
one engaged in a business or profession, no financial tycoon, educator,
researcher, farmer, housewife, welfare recipient, or unemployed person can
function without some reference to government publications.  Yet, in few
areas of recorded human knowledge have control and bibliographic aids
been so little systemized. 
  The present work, designed to provide the prospective user as well as
the trained researcher and librarian with a guide to the maze, is a direct
descendant of the Childs essay.  The extent to which the mass of published
material has grown is underscored by the contrasting physical size of the
two publications; Childs' was a 78-page pamphlet containing approximately
400 entries whereas this book of over 400 pages cites more than 3,000 titles.
