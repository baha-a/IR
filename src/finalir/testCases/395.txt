Orr, R.H.Leeds, A.A.

  This study's aim was to gather and analyze
reliable data on the quantifiable characteristics of the
biomedical literature that affects communication problems within
the research community.  Previous studies and standard
bibliographic compilations were critically reviewed, particularly
for data that could be used to determine changes with time.
In addition, all publications generated during 1961-1962 by
the extramural and intramural research programs of the
National Institutes of Health (NIH) were analyzed as samples
of the current document output of US research.
