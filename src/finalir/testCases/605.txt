Citations, References and the Growth of Scientific Literature:A Model of Dynamic Interaction

Krauze, Tadeusz K.Hillinger, Claude

   A mathematical model is presented which explains the observed exponential 
growth rates of citations and references in a scientific discipline.. The 
independent variables are the growth rate of the number of articles published 
and the decay rate of citation of old literature.. It is shown how the 
parameters of the model can be estimated..
