pressure distributions at zero lift for delta wings
with rhombic cross sections .
  the linearised theory of thin wings is used to calculate pressure
distributions over delta wings with rhombic cross sections .  a deuce
programme has been written for the calculation and some of the results
are compared with those of slender thin wing theory .
