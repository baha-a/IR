A Mathematical Theory of Communication

Shannon, C.E.

  The recent development of various methods of modulation such as PCM
and PPM which exchange bandwidth for signal-to-noise ratio has
intensified the interest in a general theory of communication.  A basis for
such a theory is contained in the important papers of Nyquist and Hartley
on this subject.  In the present paper we will extend the theory to include a
number of new factors, in particular the effect of noise in the channel, and
the savings possible due to the statistical structure of the original message
and due to the nature of the final destination of the information.
  The fundamental problem of communication is that of reproducing at
one point either exactly or approximately a message selected at another
point.  Frequently the messages have meaning; that is they refer to or are 
correlated according to some system with certain physical or conceptual
entities.  These semantic aspects of communication are irrelevant to the
engineering problem.  The significant aspect is that the actual message is
one selected from a set of possible messages.  The system must be designed
to operate for each possible selection, not just the one which will actually
be chosen since this is unknown at the time of design.
