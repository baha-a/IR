Information, Communication, Knowledge

Ziman, J.M.

  At the British Association meeting in Exeter last month, Professor
Ziman addressed the section devoted to general topics on the
question of how scientific information becomes public knowledge.
The system of communication, he implied, is not as rotten as some
like to think.
