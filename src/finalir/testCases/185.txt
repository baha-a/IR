   In order to plan adequately for education in health science librarianship
and to be able to project future demands and needs we need to know a great deal
more about existing  manpower in health science libraries.. This paper, the 
first in a series of reports on an investigation to gather this data, discusses
the research methodology and the development of an inventory of the institution
program population upon which the survey is based.. An analysis in terms of 
geographic location, type (educational, research, etc.), administrative 
control, and primary cognate area of these institutions is presented, and their
distribution through the various Regional Medical Library areas is noted..
Preliminary estimates are made, based on questionnaire to the libraries, on the
size of the library population, their relationship to reporting programs or
institutions, exclusive of the hospital population which is being covered in an
independent survey.. A questionnaire to library personnel is underway which
will establish, along with the other questionnaires, a basis for exploring the
relationships which exist between institutions or programs, libraries and
manpower..
