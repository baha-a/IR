Information Networks

Becker, J.Olsen, W.C.

  In the literature, active network plans and developments appear to cluster 
in three main areas: (1) Education, (2) Libraries, and (3) Government, Industry,
and Professional Societies.  These network groupings are described in this
chapter following a discussion of network definitions, concepts, and current
impetus.  References to information systems are included when there is an 
indication that a particular system will probably be transformed into a network.
