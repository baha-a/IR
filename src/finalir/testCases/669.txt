  The Wiswesser chemical line-notation is an unique
and unambiguous method of representing chemical
structures by a linear series of letters, numbers,
ampersands, and hyphens.  These symbols are meaningful to
chemists familiar with the notation and can be processed
by automatic data processing (ADP) equipment. 
  The uniqueness of the line-notation permits the use
of alphanumerically arranged lists of notations for
dictionary-type searches.  This ordered arrangement
permits the rapid location of a specific compound or a
specific class of ring compounds other than benzenoid.
