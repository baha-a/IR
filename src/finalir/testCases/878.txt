The Ad Hoc Discussion Group on Serials Data Bases: Its History, CurrentPosition, and Future

Anable, Richard

The Ad Hoc Discussion Group on Serials Data Bases was formed as a
result of an informal meeting held during the American Library Association's
Conference in Las Vegas on June 26, 1973.  Those in attendance were
primarily interested in the generation and maintenance of machine-readable
union files of serials.  (This author's involvement in that meeting and
the later activities of the group stems from a contract between the
National Library of Canada and York University concerning an investigation
of the problems associated with machine-readable serials files.)
