Relative Effectiveness of Document Titles and Abstractsfor Determining Relevance of Documents

Resnick, A.

  Abstract.  Individuals who received documents
through a selective dissemination of information
system were asked to determine the relevance of
documents to their work interests on the basis of 
titles and of abstracts.  The results indicate
that there was no significant difference between
the usefulness of titles and of abstracts for this
purpose.
