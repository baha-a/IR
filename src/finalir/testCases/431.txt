  This bibliography is designed to supplement capitalize Between Types of 
Libraries 1940-1956 An Annotated Bibliography by Ralph H. Stenstrom.  The staff
of the Library Research Center at the University of Illinois in cooperation
with the Illinois State Library plans to issue an annual supplement which will 
appear in Illinois libraries each year.  It is hoped the supplements issued in 
this manner can be cumulated periodically and issued in monograph form.
