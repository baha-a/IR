Storage Analysis of a Compression Coding for Document Data Bases

Heaps, H.S.

   Analysis is made of the effect of using an efficient code of compression of
terms within a document data base.. The storage efficiency  is expressed in 
terms of the vocabulary length and the values of certain parameters which 
describe the structure of the code.. For vocabularies of up to 100,000 terms
the average code length is approximately twelve bits.. No information is lost
through term truncation or abbreviation.. The tables required for coding and 
decoding may be ordered for rapid access without reduction in the ease of 
update..
