A Bayesian Approach to Interactive Retrieval

Tague, Jean M.

   This paper presents a probabilistic model for interactive retrieval.. 
Specifically, it applies the principles of Bayesian statistical decision theory:
(1) the use of both prior (subjective) and sample information about the
relationship of document descriptions to query relevance, and (2) maximization 
of the expected value of a utility function, to the problem of optimally 
restructuring a search strategy in an interactive environment..
