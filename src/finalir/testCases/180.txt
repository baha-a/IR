boundary layer over a flat plate in presence of shear
flow .
  the governing equations of an incompressible
boundary layer over a flat plate in the presence of a
shear flow with finite vorticity are derived .  for large
vorticity, a similarity solution is obtained .  for
moderate vorticity, one of the governing equations
is replaced by an approximate one for which
similarity solutions exist .
