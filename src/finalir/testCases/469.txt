The Phenomena of Interest to Information Science

Wersig, GernotNeveling, Ulrich

   Discusses the various explicit and implicit definitions of information and
information science, against a view of their historical development.. Shows how
the various views of information science overlap with other disciplines, and
concludes with a proposal for a definition of information science based on 
social need.. A schema of information sciences is put forward with the plea that
any discussion of information and information science should first declare the
definitions to be used..
